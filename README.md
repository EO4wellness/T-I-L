# T-I-L
 Today I Learned: This is a record of my personal journey.  November, 2020 is the very beginning of my first T-I-L on GitHub, but it is not my very first day of learning, and it is also not the very first day I've learned anything about coding.

###General
Currently I volunteer as a webmaster for an organization.  As part of my volunteer position, I research and teach-myself anything I don't already know how to do, in order to implement what I need to accomplish.  I've been doing this since the 1990s. 


###Git/GitHub

    Installed GitHub Desktop locally. Completed basic tutorial.  (November 18, 2000) 
        updated and set up Notepad++ as my current default Text editor
        used ctrl+shift+n to create a new branch 
        used ctrl+shift+a to open the training repository's README.md, editted it, then saved it using Notepad++
        updated the summary field and commited it using ctrl+shift+n_new-branch 
        used ctrl+p to publish (push) changes back to the GitHub repository
        used ctrl+r (to pull request) which is how people collaborate in GitHub--this is how you ask your new code or changes to be included in the main code.
