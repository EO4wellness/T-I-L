# Today I Learned [T-I-L](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/wiki)
This is a record of my personal journey.  November, 2020 is the very beginning of my first T-I-L on GitHub, but it is not my very first day of learning, and it is also not the very first day I've learned anything about coding. My personal tag line about learning is embodied in the phrase "The Road to Coding isn't Built Overnight!"

### General
* Currently I volunteer as a webmaster for an organization.  
* As part of my volunteer position, I research and teach-myself anything I don't already know how to do, in order to implement what I need to accomplish.  I've been doing this since the 1990s when I taught myself HTML from "view source" on Netscape, and then taught myself desk-top publishing reading the Help menu of InDesign. 


### Git/GitHub

* Installed GitHub Desktop locally. Completed basic tutorial.  (November 18, 2000) 
        updated and set up Notepad++ as my current default Text editor
        used ctrl+shift+n to create a new branch 
        used ctrl+shift+a to open the training repository's README.md, editted it, then saved it using Notepad++
        updated the summary field and commited it using ctrl+shift+n_new-branch 
        used ctrl+p to publish (push) changes back to the GitHub repository
        used ctrl+r (to pull request) which is how people collaborate in GitHub--this is how you ask your new code or changes to be included in the main code. 
* Consulted Markdown file to learn GitHub formatting basics 
	Read @bonn0062 article https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6 Forked welcome wall respoitory https://github.com/bonn0062/github_welcome_wall googled how to add images in MD, and added a "ThankYou.md" file 
* The "Secret" of creating a repository within your GitHub account named as your username.  
* That ReadMe.MD GetHub profile generators are a thing which exists. 
* About GitHub liscensing options https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository 
* About GitHub Contributors recognition https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/installation and installation (November 22,2020) 
* Importance of a SPACE!  Today (November 22,2020) I learned the importance of a space when my markdown text suddenly started displaying correctly, after days of NOT displaying as intended, despite consulting the style guide, simply because I neglected to see, and implement, the space between the markdown formating character(s) and the content!  
* Read and update: https://dev.to/imshravan/github-profile-readme-dynamic-quote-generator-9bo 
* (Cold as Ice)(https://www.techzine.eu/news/devops/52436/github-saves-greatest-hits-in-arctic-code-vault/?crph=1b330444af9fc782f303814618059a7d&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=China-sponsored+hacker+group+attacks+companies+worldwide&utm_campaign=Mailing%3A++China-sponsored+hacker+group+attacks+companies+worldwide&vgo_ee=rJ5R%2FYnXUvXOqv02v9u0Lr9xNL0uPdWKPfefZlVJEEE%3D)

Studied several lessons today 12-7-2020 in the ND
* 12-11 studied in ND. Saw that Microsoft came out with a similar product to [Nutanix](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-stack/hci/hci-download/?ocid=eml_pg224624_gdc_comm_az&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTURBMVlqRm1OVE0zTmpKbCIsInQiOiJTNjVJSCtJMVlMYUo0aWYxWkpDTnQ0c0ZJY1ZXZWd1TVhsN3lpeHBkUTBZa3FTcWx5bUJmSlg4YXF6WE9hWGkrYllcL2NGaEZBbWtHOEMrbnJsQ1NZcXQ1UVFcL0ZMSlp4WUpSN2tNd242MzMxdDA4OVJ1eTdtVTFLaVprb05uMmtSWWN0VVVWcTJkUFVqcmt1WVMyUG1FZz09In0%3D) and took a look at it. 

### PHP 
* Started Sololearns PHP course today (Nov 25; finished first syntax module 100%) 
  (Nov 29; finished second module 100% on variables) 
* Created a [PHP Folder](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/tree/main/PHP) in this repository with basic, beginner, .php code snippets. 

### Python 
*  took Jason Olson's "Python: The Big Picture" on PluralSight. 
*  PIP 
*  Python 2 vs Python 3 (from 2008, intentionally not backwards compatable).  Default to Python 3 all of the time and only use 2 if you need to for a site or library you're forced to use. 
*  Want to study more about using Python script with Open Source Blender 
*  Enrolled in and began https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-with-pandas-a-complete-tutorial/?Join-%40UdemyFree4You=&couponCode=CGFORUPSKILL2020 
*  Learn Python the Hard Way https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/  
*  Another Python resource https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp 
*  Women Who Code shared this resources today on LinkedIn and I want to remember to followup with it--take notes and study it--when I return to studying Python in the near future. [Women Who Code Data Visualization with Python](https://youtu.be/wvDbLhconLU) youtube tutorial.
*  Read an article about "learning" any coding takes practice and challenging one's self.  Here is [one such idea along those lines](https://renanmf.com/python-project-guessing-game/).
* learning resource https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/  
	
### Server 
* Maintenance (November 20, 21, 22 2020) 
* Maintenance and set up for email forwarders (Dec 1, 2020)
* Took screen shots and wrote documentation (how to) for what I do at the new server each time I do maintenance so if I'm not available someone could log in to replace me and duplicate what I do. 
* Coming Soon...

### WIKI
* In November, 2020, I started a T-I-L WIKI just to learn and practice more of the WIKI Github skill set.  Likely, overtime, I will also do "issues" "projects" and other additional GitHub features here in this repository to practice various aspects of what's available.  
* [Wiki Link - basically using it like an online learning blog.](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/wiki) 
* Began working more on documenting common errors within my WIKI.  The purpose of writing it is really solidifying in my mind and it is taking on its own focus now--as so often is the case when you start doing something new. 
* Today's contribution is to update my WIKI regarding GitHub, as part of my daily-study time in the Udacity Hybrid Cloud Engineer Nanodegree.
