# Today I Learned [T-I-L](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/wiki)
This is a record of my personal journey.  November, 2020 is the very beginning of my first T-I-L on GitHub, but it is not my very first day of learning, and it is also not the very first day I've learned anything about coding. My personal tag line about learning is embodied in the phrase "The Road to Coding isn't Built Overnight!"

### General
* Currently I volunteer as a webmaster for an organization.  
* As part of my volunteer position, I research and teach-myself anything I don't already know how to do, in order to implement what I need to accomplish.  I've been doing this since the 1990s when I taught myself HTML from "view source" on Netscape, and then taught myself desk-top publishing reading the Help menu of InDesign. 


### Git/GitHub

* Installed GitHub Desktop locally. Completed basic tutorial.  (November 18, 2000) 
        updated and set up Notepad++ as my current default Text editor
        used ctrl+shift+n to create a new branch 
        used ctrl+shift+a to open the training repository's README.md, editted it, then saved it using Notepad++
        updated the summary field and commited it using ctrl+shift+n_new-branch 
        used ctrl+p to publish (push) changes back to the GitHub repository
        used ctrl+r (to pull request) which is how people collaborate in GitHub--this is how you ask your new code or changes to be included in the main code. 
* Consulted Markdown file to learn GitHub formatting basics 
	Read @bonn0062 article https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6 Forked welcome wall respoitory https://github.com/bonn0062/github_welcome_wall googled how to add images in MD, and added a "ThankYou.md" file 
* The "Secret" of creating a repository within your GitHub account named as your username.  
* That ReadMe.MD GetHub profile generators are a thing which exists. 
* About GitHub liscensing options https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository 
* About GitHub Contributors recognition https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/installation and installation (November 22,2020) 
* Importance of a SPACE!  Today (November 22,2020) I learned the importance of a space when my markdown text suddenly started displaying correctly, after days of NOT displaying as intended, despite consulting the style guide, simply because I neglected to see, and implement, the space between the markdown formating character(s) and the content!  
* Read and update: https://dev.to/imshravan/github-profile-readme-dynamic-quote-generator-9bo 
* (Cold as Ice)(https://www.techzine.eu/news/devops/52436/github-saves-greatest-hits-in-arctic-code-vault/?crph=1b330444af9fc782f303814618059a7d&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=China-sponsored+hacker+group+attacks+companies+worldwide&utm_campaign=Mailing%3A++China-sponsored+hacker+group+attacks+companies+worldwide&vgo_ee=rJ5R%2FYnXUvXOqv02v9u0Lr9xNL0uPdWKPfefZlVJEEE%3D)

* Maintenance and set up for email forwarders (Dec 1, 2020)
* Took screen shots and wrote documentation (how to) for what I do at the new server each time I do maintenance so if I'm not available someone could log in to replace me and duplicate what I do. 
* Coming Soon...

### Other Iterests or TO-Dos which have not yet become To-Done listings! 
* A list or links of other topics to followup with in future T-I-L sessions:
    Using GitHub for website hosting https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-free-github-pages-website-53743d7524e1 
	Learning about newsletter listservers 
	Reading (links from SLACK which other students posted) 
* Need to learn more about Markdown and Linking--things are (yet) appearing the way I had hoped they would!  :lol: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
* https://smartcat.com/ Need to finish set up of account and connect with others there 
* Where to learn react.  A place recommended to me to start: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101  
* https://www.freecodecamp.org/  
* [Learn about Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)

### WIKI
* In November, 2020, I started a T-I-L WIKI just to learn and practice more of the WIKI Github skill set.  Likely, overtime, I will also do "issues" "projects" and other additional GitHub features here in this repository to practice various aspects of what's available.  
* [Wiki Link - basically using it like an online learning blog.](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/wiki) 
* Began working more on documenting common errors within my WIKI.  The purpose of writing it is really solidifying in my mind and it is taking on its own focus now--as so often is the case when you start doing something new.
