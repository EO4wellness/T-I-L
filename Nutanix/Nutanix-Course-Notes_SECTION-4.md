# SECTION 4: On-Premises Private Cloud Automation 


## Lesson 1: Managing Multiple cluster and Workload Resources 
1.1 Course Overview: On-Premises Private Cloud Automation!
* Previously, we've learned infrastructure modernization with HCI and the evolution of the modern Hybric cloud.  We'e also learned about the basic drawbacks of legacy IT infrastructure.  It just cannot keep up with business today. 
* Nutanix integrates all IT resources to run any application. Nutanix is a simple and effective approach to meet business needs: security, management of VMs (virtual machines), networking, disaster recovery.
* Automation eliminates the most time-consuming parts of managing IT resources manually.  
* Nutanix Prism and Nutanix Calm are two key components in the Nutanix automation process which can overcome repetitive and laborious IT tasks. 
* Nutanix Pris helps manage multiple workloads and clusters. 
* Nutanix Calm is simple and provides repeatable and automated management of app creation, consumption, and governance. 

1.2 Lesson Overview: On-Premises Private Cloud Automation!
* Focus on Prism. 
* Prism is a management plane of the Hybrid Cloud solution.
* Prism allows for visualizing the cloud infrastructure. 
* Prism is key to identity management, role-based access contro, image management, self-service, and categories. 
* All of Prism's features play a role in successfully contributing to the effective management of VMs and workloads.
