## Lesson 2 Konwledge, Community, and Careers
This section is to help the student become familiar with the process of earning a Udacity Nanodegree. 


## 2.1 What it Takes: 
* perserverance
* dedication
* focus on your goals 
* self-paced, self-starter 
* discussion of what successful completion looks like 
* don't quit-continue until you finish 


## 2.2 Getting Help:
* CLICK "HELP" from within your program dashboard. 
* Technical Mentor Support (Knowledge Platofrm) - likely you're not the first person to ask the question, so search for answers first.
* Peer Chat - encouraging and great links to LinkedIn, Events, GitHub and projects. . . even new start ups. 
* Career Support - fabulous resource; take advantage of it! 
* General Account Help - when something goes wrong, people are available to help (so far I've never needed to use this aspect of the account) 


## 2.3 Knowledge: 
* Knowledge is a Technical assistance platform. 
* You can search for answers to the questions other students in your program have had & answered. 
* There are technical mentors ready to answer any/all new questions 
* See the Knowledge screen for areas to search existing questions and answers; ask a new question, or filter for project-specific qustions and answers. 
* email and url addresses given for help (not published here) 
* How to ask GREAT questions: 
	Ask Spcific Questions - Ask one question per topic unless you have multiple related questions 
	Provide Details and Links - What did you try?  What helped, what didn't.  Describe the error message(s) or issues in details, as well as the steps to get there. 
	Start with a Clear Question Title - it is the intro--so phrase it well for your topic 
	Share Code Correctly - Use the "code block" to share the code so it doesn't turn to markup or text. 
	Finding out Erros - if your question is about the error message or a stack trace you've received, include the entire message.  If need be, use a GIST, Paste on Pastebin, or other link to the error message. 
	Avoid Screenshots of Code or Error Messages - Avoid screen shots of error messages or of code.  They are often hard to read and the text from a screenshot cannot be easily copied to help debug your code. 
	Answer - If you solve the problem with an answer you've received, kinly mark it "Accepted Answer' to help other future students with the same question/issues. Up vote answers which helped you (even if you aren't the person who asked the original question) 
	Another Mentor.  No everyone connects with everyone else.  If you still need help, even after receiving your answer, pick the Another Mentor" option to have a fresh set of eyes look at the issue(s).


## 2.4 Student Hub: 
* student hub provides collaboration with other students. 
* Don't be shy about sharing and visiting LinkedIn links. begin building a network of like-minded professionals you can turn to. 
* Don't over look peer project specific channels for help and interaction(s).
* You can also directly message anyone in the student hub. 


## 2.5 Career services: 
* this valuable service can help if your goal is seeking a new career, learning new skills for your current employment, or just exploring potential new outcomes in the tech industry 
* career services can provide specific feedback 
* industry professionals can also offer feedback 
* accessed thru your student dashboard under the "career" channel 
* there are [career events](https://www.udacity.com/events)
