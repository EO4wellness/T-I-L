Configuration drift: 
Refers to active configurations diverging from the configuration that was originally tested, approved, and deployed. Configuration drift is largely the result of manual processes, since these changes usually involve an actual person connecting to the server to make changes.


Configuration management: 
A category of software that can be considered the next generation of scripting.


Continuous delivery: 
A software engineering practice that involves keeping code in a state in which it is ready to deploy at any given time.


Continuous deployment: 
A software engineering practice that Involves the frequent, automated release of code to production.


Continuous integration: 
A software engineering practice that involves multiple developers merging their individual code changes into the main repository as frequently as possible, usually multiple times a day.


Continuous operations: 
A software engineering practice which involves ensuring that IT operations are non-disruptive to users.


Domain-specific language (DSL): 
A computer language specialized to a particular application domain. You can think of a DSL as a way of simplifying programming tasks that are specific to a domain or product.


General-purpose language (GPL): 
A computer programming language which is broadly applicable across domains.


Immutable infrastructure: 
A system that does not change after deployment. This means that no updates, patches, or configuration changes are made to production systems. If changes are needed, a new version of the architecture is built and deployed into production.


Lift and shift: 
The most common strategy for migrating workloads among datacenters, infrastructure providers, hypervisors, clouds (or even from physical to virtual machine, or from virtual machine to container), which is done through storage conversion.


OpenAPI Specification: 
Formerly called the Swagger Specification, the OpenAPI Specification is an API description format for REST APIs.


Push button environments: 
This refers to changing your existing, brownfield workloads (which have a lot of hard-coded configuration, data, and state in them) to push-button simplicity for new workload instances.


Runbook: 
A collection of orchestration tasks defining what to do and where to do it.


Swagger: 
A set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.
