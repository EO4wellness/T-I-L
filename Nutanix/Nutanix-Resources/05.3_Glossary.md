Application Profiles - An application profile provides different combinations of the service, package, and VM while configuring a blueprint.

Blueprint - A blueprint is the framework for every application that you model by using Nutanix Calm. Blueprints are templates that describe all the steps that are required to provision, configure, and execute tasks on the services and applications that are created.

Calm - It provisions, scales, and manages infrastructure and applications across multiple environments to make the entire IT infrastructure more agile and application-centric.

Services - Services are the virtual machine instances, existing machines or bare-metal machines, that you can provision and configure by using Nutanix Calm.
