# SECTION 2: Modern Private Cloud Infrastructure (100% Completed, November, 2020)

# SECTION 3: Intro to Private and Hybrid Cloud Automation 
## Lesson 1: Intro to Private and Hybrid Cloud Automation 
## Lesson 1.1  Meet your Instructor: Mark Lavi 
## Lesson 1.2 Prerequisites 
* Command Line 
* VM Experiences 
* On Premise or Public Cloud 
* Web server familiarity 
* Basic DB and SQL 

## Lesson 1.3 Intro to Private and Hybrid Cloud Automation 
* Increasing complexity and scale. 
* Stream line apps and dev ops. 
* Automation alone is not the solution to rein in costs or assist in the  managment of infrastructure at scale.

## Lesson 1.4 DevOps and Digital Transformation 
* DevOps movement spawned from lean manufacturing philosophy and the agile software movement. 
* Massive paradigm shift.
* Ease of Collaboration 
* Any Scale, on demand. 
* Hot fixes (1,000s of times a day) 
* DevOps is a process of removing friction between the developer and the customer.  
* DevOps is constently evolving to reduce frictions.  It is not static.  It is an evolving process.  
* DevOps needs to be non-disruptive, be able to fully scale at any moment, and to be able to do so at any location in the world. 
* HCI model (self-service provisioning) 
* Nutanix Calm orchestrates provisioning, scaling, and management of applications across environments making it more agile. 
* Self-service of applications.  Calm uses Blueprint to control all aspects of the application's lifestyle. 

Nutanix Calm
		Application self-service helps realize the vision of IT-as-a-Service
		Calm uses blueprints to control all aspects of an application's lifecycle.  
		Calm accelerates automation further by supporting DSL in addition to the GUI
		This ultimately reduces complexity, improves quality, and speeds delivery. 
		Calm's Automation capababilities enable speed, simplicity and agility. 
		Calm is Python-based 
		DSL - Domain Specific Language 
		Version-Controlled Blueprints 
		Once created, a blueprint can be published thru the Nutanix Marketplace and be available on one-click request, no matter how complex they might be. 
		Calm offers: CI (Continuious Integration 
                             Delivery
                             CD (deployment)
		Reduces complexity, improves quality and speed of delivery 

## Lesson 1.5 When will you apply this knowledge? 
* Businesses are struggling with cloud adaptation. (Not achieving goals or not having a plan which can be inplementing) 
* Focus on business requirements - Cloud is only USEFUL if it meets business needs. 
* Look for solutions to meet the business requirements. 
* Hybrid Cloud Engineers work with the organization and all stake holders to write service level agreements (defined, documented and agreed upon) to determine the plan of implementation, and then ongoing maintance of provisioning. 

## Lesson 1.6 Working with Business Stakeholders
* Transforming a business to the cloud invovles nearly every aspect/department of a business. 
* Important to gather all stakeholders and information about each business application as it pertains to the cloud to ensure readiness when the cloud plan is implemented. 
* People, processes, technology use, application design, requirements, accounting, compliance, security, scalability. 
* Focus on:
	1. Application Portability needs. 
	2. Compliance and Security needs. 
	3. Cost, including TCO and ROI.
	4. Scalability 
	5. Resilience and availability 
	6. Performance 
	7. Manageability 
	8. Data protection needs and recoverability needs. 

## Lesson 1.7 Overview of Upcoming Sections. 
Overview of what will be learned and syllabus for the course. 
Need to understand when to move from private to public.  
Or--for Public to private.
Why & when. 

## Lesson 1.8 Tools, Environment & Dependencies
It is pretty awesome that the Nutnix frame Virtual Desktop (Windows10), Nutanix Private Cloud clusts with Acropolis AHV Hypervisoor AOS 5.15 and Prism Central with Nutanix Calm 3.x is all enabled within the course worklabs so that no software needs to be installed AND all of the projects in the course can be worked through using the lab space AND you don't need any special software or access. 

## Lesson 1.9 Project Overviews 
### Project 1 (completed in the above coursework)
### Project 2 includes: 
* Create a three-tier web application blueprint that satisfies the IaaS business requirements for self-service private cloud deployment and security scenarios.
* Enhance the blueprint to provide PaaS by configuring the web application and creating web-tier scaling. Test the web application works by confirming scale-out load balancing across the web tier and database write updates.
* Enhance the blueprint to provide an action to update the database password and update the web application to use the new password, achieving a SaaS-like experience for developers with delegated, post deployment operations. Test the web application works with the new password.
### Project 3 is: Hybrid Cloud SaaS: Three-Tier Web Application
In the project at the end of the Public and Hybrid Cloud Management course, you will extend your three-tier web application blueprint to the public cloud in order to maximize high availability and provide scalable performance. In addition, you will be tasked with creating small and medium deployment scenarios.

## Lesson 1.10 Good Luck! - Our instructor mentions that he wakes up every day super excited to do his job and is passing that on to us in this course. 

# SECTION 4: On-Premises Private Cloud Automation 


## Lesson 1: Managing Multiple cluster and Workload Resources 
1.1 Course Overview: On-Premises Private Cloud Automation!
* Previously, we've learned infrastructure modernization with HCI and the evolution of the modern Hybric cloud.  We'e also learned about the basic drawbacks of legacy IT infrastructure.  It just cannot keep up with business today. 
* Nutanix integrates all IT resources to run any application. Nutanix is a simple and effective approach to meet business needs: security, management of VMs (virtual machines), networking, disaster recovery.
* Automation eliminates the most time-consuming parts of managing IT resources manually.  
* Nutanix Prism and Nutanix Calm are two key components in the Nutanix automation process which can overcome repetitive and laborious IT tasks. 
* Nutanix Pris helps manage multiple workloads and clusters. 
* Nutanix Calm is simple and provides repeatable and automated management of app creation, consumption, and governance. 

1.2 Lesson Overview: On-Premises Private Cloud Automation!
* Focus on Prism. 
* Prism is a management plane of the Hybrid Cloud solution.
* Prism allows for visualizing the cloud infrastructure. 
* Prism is key to identity management, role-based access contro, image management, self-service, and categories. 
* All of Prism's features play a role in successfully contributing to the effective management of VMs and workloads.

3.  [One-on-One calls](https://www.udacity.com/career-services/home): I took full advantage of these wonderful programs.  Appointments: 2020-10-28 with Bret; 2020-12-08 with Andrea. After each 1-on-1 session, each career counselor also sends a follow up email with excellent resoruces to followup with the discussion and recommendation points. Very helpful and useful.
