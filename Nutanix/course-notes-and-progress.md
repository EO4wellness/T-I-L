## Lesson 1: Intro to Private and Hybrid Cloud Automation 
## Lesson 1.1  Meet your Instructor: Mark Lavi 
## Lesson 1.2 Prerequisites 
* Command Line 
* VM Experiences 
* On Premise or Public Cloud 
* Web server familiarity 
* Basic DB and SQL 

## Lesson 1.3 Intro to Private and Hybrid Cloud Automation 
* Increasing complexity and scale. 
* Stream line apps and dev ops. 
* Automation alone is not the solution to rein in costs or assist in the  managment of infrastructure at scale.

## Lesson 1.4 DevOps and Digital Transformation 
* DevOps movement spawned from lean manufacturing philosophy and the agile software movement. 
* Massive paradigm shift.
* Ease of Collaboration 
* Any Scale, on demand. 
* Hot fixes (1,000s of times a day) 
* DevOps is a process of removing friction between the developer and the customer.  
* DevOps is constently evolving to reduce frictions.  It is not static.  It is an evolving process.  
* DevOps needs to be non-disruptive, be able to fully scale at any moment, and to be able to do so at any location in the world. 
* HCI model (self-service provisioning) 
* Nutanix Calm orchestrates provisioning, scaling, and management of applications across environments making it more agile. 
* Self-service of applications.  Calm uses Blueprint to control all aspects of the application's lifestyle. 

Nutanix Calm

## Lesson 1.5 When will you apply this knowledge? 
* Businesses are struggling with cloud adaptation. (Not achieving goals or not having a plan which can be inplementing) 
* Focus on business requirements - Cloud is only USEFUL if it meets business needs. 
* Look for solutions to meet the business requirements. 
* Hybrid Cloud Engineers work with the organization and all stake holders to write service level agreements (defined, documented and agreed upon) to determine the plan of implementation, and then ongoing maintance of provisioning. 

## Lesson 1.6 Working with Business Stakeholders
* Transforming a business to the cloud invovles nearly every aspect/department of a business. 
* Important to gather all stakeholders and information about each business application as it pertains to the cloud to ensure readiness when the cloud plan is implemented. 
* People, processes, technology use, application design, requirements, accounting, compliance, security, scalability. 
* Focus on:
	1. Application Portability needs. 
	2. Compliance and Security needs. 
	3. Cost, including TCO and ROI.
	4. Scalability 
	5. Resilience and availability 
	6. Performance 
	7. Manageability 
	8. Data protection needs and recoverability needs.
