## Lesson 2 Konwledge, Community, and Careers
This section is to help the student become familiar with the process of earning a Udacity Nanodegree. 


## 2.1 What it Takes: 
* perserverance
* dedication
* focus on your goals 
* self-paced, self-starter 
* discussion of what successful completion looks like 
* don't quit-continue until you finish 


## 2.2 Getting Help:
* CLICK "HELP" from within your program dashboard. 
* Technical Mentor Support (Knowledge Platofrm) - likely you're not the first person to ask the question, so search for answers first.
* Peer Chat - encouraging and great links to LinkedIn, Events, GitHub and projects. . . even new start ups. 
* Career Support - fabulous resource; take advantage of it! 
* General Account Help - when something goes wrong, people are available to help (so far I've never needed to use this aspect of the account) 


## 2.3 Knowledge: 
* Knowledge is a Technical assistance platform. 
* You can search for answers to the questions other students in your program have had & answered. 
* There are technical mentors ready to answer any/all new questions 
* See the Knowledge screen for areas to search existing questions and answers; ask a new question, or filter for project-specific qustions and answers. 
* email and url addresses given for help (not published here) 
* How to ask GREAT questions: 
	Ask Spcific Questions - Ask one question per topic unless you have multiple related questions 
	Provide Details and Links - What did you try?  What helped, what didn't.  Describe the error message(s) or issues in details, as well as the steps to get there. 
	Start with a Clear Question Title - it is the intro--so phrase it well for your topic 
	Share Code Correctly - Use the "code block" to share the code so it doesn't turn to markup or text. 
	Finding out Erros - if your question is about the error message or a stack trace you've received, include the entire message.  If need be, use a GIST, Paste on Pastebin, or other link to the error message. 
	Avoid Screenshots of Code or Error Messages - Avoid screen shots of error messages or of code.  They are often hard to read and the text from a screenshot cannot be easily copied to help debug your code. 
	Answer - If you solve the problem with an answer you've received, kinly mark it "Accepted Answer' to help other future students with the same question/issues. Up vote answers which helped you (even if you aren't the person who asked the original question) 
	Another Mentor.  No everyone connects with everyone else.  If you still need help, even after receiving your answer, pick the Another Mentor" option to have a fresh set of eyes look at the issue(s).


## 2.4 Student Hub: 
* student hub provides collaboration with other students. 
* Don't be shy about sharing and visiting LinkedIn links. begin building a network of like-minded professionals you can turn to. 
* Don't over look peer project specific channels for help and interaction(s).
* You can also directly message anyone in the student hub. 


## 2.5 Career services: 
* this valuable service can help if your goal is seeking a new career, learning new skills for your current employment, or just exploring potential new outcomes in the tech industry 
* career services can provide specific feedback 
* industry professionals can also offer feedback 
* accessed thru your student dashboard under the "career" channel 
* there are [career events](https://www.udacity.com/events)

## Lesson 1.2 Prerequisites: 
* Command Line 
* VM Experiences 
* On Premise or Public Cloud 
* Web server familiarity 
* Basic DB and SQL 


## Lesson 1.3 Intro to Private and Hybrid Cloud Automation:  
* Increasing complexity and scale. 
* Automate repetative tasks reduces error AND increases productivity 
* Work loads and requirements change quickly 
* Tech needs to change quickly too--but it is complex and prone to error. 
* Stream line apps and dev ops. 
* Automation alone is not the solution to rein in costs or assist in the  managment of infrastructure at scale.


## Lesson 1.4 DevOps and Digital Transformation 
* DevOps movement spawned from lean manufacturing philosophy and the agile software movement. 
* Massive paradigm shift.
* Ease of Collaboration 
* Any Scale, on demand. 
* Hot fixes (1,000s of times a day) 
* DevOps is a process of removing friction between the developer and the customer.  
* DevOps is constently evolving to reduce frictions.  It is not static.  It is an evolving process.  
* DevOps needs to be non-disruptive, be able to fully scale at any moment, and to be able to do so at any location in the world. 
* HCI model (self-service provisioning) 
* Nutanix Calm orchestrates provisioning, scaling, and management of applications across environments making it more agile. 
* Self-service of applications.  Calm uses Blueprint to control all aspects of the application's lifestyle. 

Nutanix Calm
		Application self-service helps realize the vision of IT-as-a-Service
		Calm uses blueprints to control all aspects of an application's lifecycle.  
		Calm accelerates automation further by supporting DSL in addition to the GUI
		This ultimately reduces complexity, improves quality, and speeds delivery. 
		Calm's Automation capababilities enable speed, simplicity and agility. 
		Calm is Python-based

		Calm offers: CI (Continuious Integration 
                             Delivery
                             CD (deployment)
		Reduces complexity, improves quality and speed of delivery 

## Lesson 1.5 When will you apply this knowledge? 
* Businesses are struggling with cloud adaptation. (Not achieving goals or not having a plan which can be inplementing) 
* Focus on business requirements - Cloud is only USEFUL if it meets business needs. 
* Look for solutions to meet the business requirements. 
* Hybrid Cloud Engineers work with the organization and all stake holders to write service level agreements (defined, documented and agreed upon) to determine the plan of implementation, and then ongoing maintance of provisioning. 

## Lesson 1.6 Working with Business Stakeholders
* Transforming a business to the cloud invovles nearly every aspect/department of a business. 
* Important to gather all stakeholders and information about each business application as it pertains to the cloud to ensure readiness when the cloud plan is implemented. 
* People, processes, technology use, application design, requirements, accounting, compliance, security, scalability. 
* Focus on:
	1. Application Portability needs. 
	2. Compliance and Security needs. 
	3. Cost, including TCO and ROI.
	4. Scalability 
	5. Resilience and availability 
	6. Performance 
	7. Manageability 
	8. Data protection needs and recoverability needs. 

## Lesson 1.7 Overview of Upcoming Sections. 
Overview of what will be learned and syllabus for the course. 
Need to understand when to move from private to public.  
Or--for Public to private.
Why & when. 

## Lesson 1.8 Tools, Environment & Dependencies
It is pretty awesome that the Nutnix frame Virtual Desktop (Windows10), Nutanix Private Cloud clusts with Acropolis AHV Hypervisoor AOS 5.15 and Prism Central with Nutanix Calm 3.x is all enabled within the course worklabs so that no software needs to be installed AND all of the projects in the course can be worked through using the lab space AND you don't need any special software or access. 

## Lesson 1.9 Project Overviews 
### Project 1 (completed in the above coursework)
### Project 2 includes: 
* Create a three-tier web application blueprint that satisfies the IaaS business requirements for self-service private cloud deployment and security scenarios.
* Enhance the blueprint to provide PaaS by configuring the web application and creating web-tier scaling. Test the web application works by confirming scale-out load balancing across the web tier and database write updates.
* Enhance the blueprint to provide an action to update the database password and update the web application to use the new password, achieving a SaaS-like experience for developers with delegated, post deployment operations. Test the web application works with the new password.
### Project 3 is: Hybrid Cloud SaaS: Three-Tier Web Application
In the project at the end of the Public and Hybrid Cloud Management course, you will extend your three-tier web application blueprint to the public cloud in order to maximize high availability and provide scalable performance. In addition, you will be tasked with creating small and medium deployment scenarios.

## Lesson 1.10 Good Luck! - Our instructor mentions that he wakes up every day super excited to do his job and is passing that on to us in this course.
