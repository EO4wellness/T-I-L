# SUSE Community 
* In June 2021, I received a [SUSE Native Cloud Scholarship](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/tree/master/SUSE%20Scholarship) at Udacity. 
* While participating in the scholarship, I was invited to join a course online.
* When I arrived to the link destination, it was the SUSE online community!  
* Now I'm taking SUSE community courses! 
* This is my log of my learning adventures.
