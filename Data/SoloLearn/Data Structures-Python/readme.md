* Almost no program can work properly without data. 
* Python has a number of built-in data structures, 
* which allow you to store, organize, and manage your data. 
* In this course, we will learn about different Python Data Structures 
* such as strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and much more.

1. Working With Strings (7 Lessons) 
2. Lists (6 Lessons) 
3. Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets (8 Lessons) 
4. User-Defined Data Structures (7 Lessons) 
* Certification - Granted upon completion 

## Working With Strings (7 Lessons) 
1.1 Lesson: Data Structures 
Python Data Structures
Almost every program uses data.
Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications.

Data Structures allow you to store and manage your data.

Python has a number of built-in data structures:
- Strings
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets

During this course, we will learn about these data structures, use them to store data and see their real-life applications. 
 
If you are not familiar with the basics of Python, please complete our Python for Beginners course first.

QUIZ: What is a string? 
- a whole number (wrong)
- text (correct answer) 
- a function (wrong) 


In addition to the built-in data structures, Python allows you to create your own data structures, enabling you to have full control over their functionality.

The most prominent data structures are:
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Linked Lists
These data structures have many uses in popular algorithms. We will learn about them in the coming modules.

QUIZ: Which of the following is a built-in-strut in Pyton? 
- tree (create your own, not built-in) 
- set (correct answer) 
- stack (create your own, not built-in) 

2.1 Lesson: Strings 
Strings are used to store text, and are one of the simplest and most used data structures.

Any text between two single or double quotation marks is a string.

For example:
```
x = "Hello world"
print(x)
```
In the example above, the variable x now represents a string.

QUIZ: Code to output "Python" 
``` print("Python")
```


There are a number of special characters that can be used in strings.
\n represents a new line:

```
print('One \nTwo \nThree')
```
The above code example, outputs: 
One <br>
Two  <br>
Three <br>

Similarly, \t represents a tab.

If you want to include a single quote in a single-quoted string (or a double quote in a double-quoted string), you need to escape it using a backslash: 

```
print('Brian\'s mother: He\'s not an angel. He\'s a very naughty boy!')
```

The output of the above code example is: Brian's mother: He's not an angel. He's a very naughty boy!

The backslash is also called the escape character.

Special Characters Quiz: 
How many lines does this code ouptut? 
``` print("1\n2\n345\n6") ```

The output will look like this: 
``` 
1
2
345
6
```
which is 4 lines of output (correct answer is 4) 


3.1 Lesson Accessing Strings 
Strings can be thought of as a sequence of characters. Each character in the string has its unique position (or index).

You can access a character of a string using its index:
```
x = "Hello"
print(x[2])
```
The output of this code is the first L in the string "hello".  Why?  Because we start counting from zero so the index positions of each place in the string are: 
```
H print(x[0])
e print(x[1])
l print(x[2]) <--this is the correct answer for our quiz 
l print(x[3])
o print(x[4])

The code above accesses the 3rd character of the string. 

The index starts from 0, meaning that the first character has the index 0

QUIZ: Accessing Strings
Fill in the blanks to output the first character of the string.
```
str = "Some text"
print(str[0 ])
```


You can also use negative indices, which access the characters of the string counting from the end.
For example:
```
x = "Hello"
print(x[-1])  
```
The output of the above code is 0.  That's because the code above accesses the last character of the string. 

QUIZ: What is the output of this code?
```
x = "awesome"
print(x[-2])
```
- m 
- e
- s 
- 0 
the answer is M (second from end) 

You can loop through the characters in a string using a for loop:
```
x = "Hello"
for c in x:
    print(c)
```
