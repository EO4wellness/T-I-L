Dec 3, 2020 Course Notes. 

Really enjoyed this lesson. Thought I would share some of my course notes from today's study session with this material.
In this lesson, The Analytical Problem, we learned about the Problem Solving Framework and its six steps which help us define the problem to be analyzed using the Predictive Mythology Map.
There are six steps n the Problem Solving Framework (which is what we are calling it in this coursework but it is also known by the acronym CRISP-DM which is short for "Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining"--referring to the fact this framework was developed by data miners.)
Problem Solving Framework:
Business issue understanding 
Data understanding 
Data preparation 
Analysis/Modeling 
Validation 
Presentation/Visualization
I especially like the instructor's take on what to do once the correct analysis method has been determined and the data has been analyzed.  The point is to find the answer(s).  Once the answer(s) is(are) identified, then the most important thing is how they are communicated.  The answer(s) are meaningless IF the audience requesting those answer cannot understand them.   The instructor coined my new favorite phrase:  It is important to not just SHOW UP and THROW UP!"   I've seen so many business presentations (or even news media or school presentations) which do the "show up and throw up" approach.  To get around it, the instructor recommends focusing on considering these main points:
Determine the best method of presenting insights based on the analysis
Determine the best method of presenting insights based on the audience
Make sure the amount of information shared is not overwhelming
Use the results to tell a story to the audience
For more complex analyses, you may want to walk the audience through the analytical problem solving process
Always reference the data sources used
Make sure your analysis supports the decisions that need to be made
Ultimately--it often helps to TELL a story.

In addition to the notes from #l1_analytical_problem  I thought I would share a list of terms I made from #l2_analytical_framework which I'm personally using to quiz myself and review my understanding and am sharing if anyone else would like to do so. Also, I noticed Alteryx also has usecase scenarios available on their website, lots of training and other materials, as well as an active and interactive community.  https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-Use-Cases/tkb-p/use-cases
