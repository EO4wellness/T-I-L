# Data 
* There are a LOT of topics in the tech-related world which pertain to Data. 
* I've not done any focused study yet, on Data, other than how it intersects with other topics.  For example: 
- AI and ML:  Udacity's DeepLearning Nanodegree studies included data cleaning
              Data Structure 
              Pandas 
- LinkedIn: had some courses distinguishing business data and business analytics vs. AI / ML Data 
- SoloLearn: DataScience and Data Structures course for Python 
- LeetCode
- Udemy: Purchased, began, but have not yet finished a course on data wrangling.
- Udacity: Took an intro to data wrangling course.  
* In the future I plan on taking a closer look at data bases (SQL and MondoDB)
