## [Intro](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp)
* jQuery is a JavaScript Library.
* jQuery greatly simplifies JavaScript programming.
* jQuery is easy to learn.
* Should know HTML, CSS, JavaScript first 
* Still widely used (but some off-site news it is being phased out)

How to add jQuery to your web pages?
1. Download the jQuery library from [jQuery.com](http://jquery.com/download/)
   - Production Version (minified and compressed) 
   - Development Version (uncompressed, readable core) 
```
The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):
<head>
<script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
</head>

Tip: Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages where you wish to use it.
```
2. Include jQuery from a CDN like Google 
If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:
Google CDN:
```
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head> 
```

One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google:

Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.
