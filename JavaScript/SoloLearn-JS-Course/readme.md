## Creating Your First JavaScript 
### Ready. Set. JavaScript!
* Let’s start with the basics and add some JavaScript to a webpage.
* On the web, JavaScript code lives inside the HTML document, 
* and needs to be enclosed by <script> and </script>:
* The HTML:
```
<script>
   ...
</script>
```
* Heads up!
* You can put the script tag anywhere in the HTML document.

QUIZ: Ready. Set. JavaScript!
What tag do you need to use to enclose the JavaScript code?
- style
- code
- body
- script 

### Output 
* Let's use JavaScript to print "Hello World" to the browser. 
* This is what that would look like.Notice some extra stuff there? Nothing gets past you!
* Hello World: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1024/1124/1344/1 
* Time to introduce the document.write() function. 
* This is what we need to use to write text into our HTML document.
* Feeling fancy? Of course you are!
*  You can also use standard HTML markup language to customize the appearance text in the output: 
*  Heads up!
*  document.write() should be used only for testing. We’ll cover some other output mechanisms real soon.

QUIZ: Output
Output "Hello!" in the browser.
```
<script>
  document.write("Hello!"); 
</script>
```

### Output to console
* Right, we’re now experts in writing HTML output with document.write().
* Time for a different type of output. Let’s learn about output to the browser console.
* For this we’ll be needing the trusty console.log() function.
* Wait, not so fast! What’s this console we’re talking about?
* The console is part of the web browser and allows you to log messages, 
* run JavaScript code, and see errors and warnings.
* It looks like this:
``` console.log("Hello from console!")```
* Heads Up!
* Devs mostly use the console to test their JavaScript code. 
* Awesome! Write a program to print the expression to the console.
  Output: 
  Write a program to output the text "JavaScript is awesome!" to the console.
  Don’t forget the exclamation mark !
  Use console.log() to output the text to the console.

```
//my solution to output "JavaScript is awesome!"
console.log("JavaScript is awesome!")
```
* Result: Practice makes perfect! You have solved the challenge

QUIZ: Output to console
Complete the code to output "Hi!" to the console.
``` console.log("Hi!")
