# SoloLearn JavaScript Course
* Began studies May 1, 2021. 
* in this course sololearn promises we will learn all the basic features of Javascript
* it can be used to make your website more interactive
* used in changing website content
* used to validate forms
* and so much more...

# Overview (6 lessons)
* Welcome to JavaScript
* Do we even need to introduce JavaScript? (Yes, someone is always "new" to any topic)
* It’s one of the most popular programming languages on the planet!
* Ever visited a website that made you think…
* "Hey, this website is really cool and interactive"? 
* Well, JavaScript was probably making it happen.
* So it’s just useful for websites right? Wrong! 
* Process data, mobile and desktop apps, games, the world’s your oyster with JavaScript. 


## [Introduction](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1024/1123/1331/1)  
* Whether it’s client-side or server-side, create the program of your dreams by unlocking the fundamentals of JavaScript.

QUIZ: 
Welcome to JavaScript
Which is the correct statement?
- JavaScript can be used to create interactive web elements (correct answer) 
- JavaScript is not a client-side language
- JavaScript is only for web apps


## [Creating Your First JavaScript](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1024/1124/1342/1)

### Ready. Set. JavaScript!
* Let’s start with the basics and add some JavaScript to a webpage.
* On the web, JavaScript code lives inside the HTML document, 
* and needs to be enclosed by <script> and </script>:
* The HTML:
```
<script>
    // javascript would go here inside the HTML document 
</script>
```
* Heads up!
* You can put the script tag anywhere in the HTML document.

QUIZ: Ready. Set. JavaScript!
What tag do you need to use to enclose the JavaScript code?
- style
- code
- body
- script 

### Output 
* Let's use JavaScript to print "Hello World" to the browser. 
* This is what that would look like.Notice some extra stuff there? Nothing gets past you!
* Hello World: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1024/1124/1344/1 
* Time to introduce the document.write() function. 
* This is what we need to use to write text into our HTML document.
* Feeling fancy? Of course you are!
*  You can also use standard HTML markup language to customize the appearance text in the output: 
*  Heads up!
*  document.write() should be used only for testing. We’ll cover some other output mechanisms real soon.

QUIZ: Output
Output "Hello!" in the browser.
```
<script>
  document.write("Hello!"); 
</script>
```

### Output to console
* Right, we’re now experts in writing HTML output with document.write().
* Time for a different type of output. Let’s learn about output to the browser console.
* For this we’ll be needing the trusty console.log() function.
* Wait, not so fast! What’s this console we’re talking about?
* The console is part of the web browser and allows you to log messages, 
* run JavaScript code, and see errors and warnings.
* It looks like this:
``` console.log("Hello from console!")```
* Heads Up!
* Devs mostly use the console to test their JavaScript code. 
* Awesome! Write a program to print the expression to the console.
  Output: 
  Write a program to output the text "JavaScript is awesome!" to the console.
  Don’t forget the exclamation mark !
  Use console.log() to output the text to the console.

```
//my solution to output "JavaScript is awesome!"
console.log("JavaScript is awesome!")
```
* Result: Practice makes perfect! You have solved the challenge

QUIZ: Output to console
Complete the code to output "Hi!" to the console.
``` console.log("Hi!") ```

## [Variables](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1024/1128/1362/1)
* Variables are containers for storing data values.
*  The value of a variable can change throughout the program.
*  Declaring a variable is as simple as using the keyword var.
*  Which would look like this: ``` var x = 10; ```
*  In this example we’ve assigned a value of 10 to the variable x.
*  We’ve used the word assigned deliberately here, because in JavaScript, 
*  the equal sign (=) is actually called the "assignment" operator, 
*  rather than an "equal to" operator.
*  Which means that in JavaScript, x = y will assign the value of y to x variable. 
*  Heads up!
*  JavaScript is sensitive, case sensitive that is. 
*  So variables like lastName and lastname are not the same.

QUIZ: Variables
How do we tell JavaScript that we're working with a variable?
- vrb
- int
- variable
- var (correct) 

### Using Variables
* Ok, let’s put some of what we’ve learned together!
* How about we assign a value to a variable and output it to the browser. We’ve got this! 
```
var x = 100;
document.write(x);
```
* But what’s the point of variables anyway? 
* Well, imagine your program has 1000 lines of code that include the variable x. 
* With variables you can change the value of the variables 
* and use them multiple times in your code:
* Like this:
```
var x = 100;
console.log(x);

x = 42;
console.log(x);
```
* Heads Up!
* Every written "instruction" is called a statement. 
* JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.

QUIZ: Using Variables
Choose the correct keyword to declare a variable and assign the value of 32.
```
var my_variable = 32;
```

### Naming Variables
* Let’s talk about names.
* It’s super important to remember that JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive.
* What do you think the output of the following code would be? 
```
var x = 100;
document.write(X);
```
* output is an error (because there is a smaller-case x and a capital-case X)
* That’s right! An error. That’s because x and X are different, and we didn't declare the X variable.
* Brace yourself for more rules!
- The first character of a variable name must be a letter, underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($) (Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs).
- The first character of a variable name can’t be a number.
- Variable names can’t include a mathematical or logical operator in their name. For instance, 2*something or this+that;
- Variable names can’t contain spaces.
- You’re not allowed to use any special symbols, like my#num, num%, etc.
* Heads up! JavaScript is a hyphen free zone. They’re reserved for subtractions. 

QUIZ: Naming Variables
Which of these characters can we use to start a variable?
- numbers (incorrect) 
- letters (correct)
- mathematical operators (incorrect) 
- underscore sign (_) (Correct)
