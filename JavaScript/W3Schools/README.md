## Why Learn JavaScript: 
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages 
   
## What is JavaScript:
* It is free
* It doesn't need to be downloaded or installed.
* It runs in your browser. 
* It is popular.
* It is fairly easy to learn. 

# [JavaScript Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)
* JavaScript can change HTML content. 
* One popular JavaScript method to change HTML content is by: 

       getElementById()
       
       Example:
       document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript"; 
       
       [Code](https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GMWGENM6FWMJ)
* WIth JavaScript you can use either 'single quotes' or "double quotes"
* It can be used to change HTML Attribute Values.

        In this example JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute 
        of an <img> tag:
        
        [Code](https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GMWH1H9NZ7J9)
        
* JavaScript can Change HTML Styles (CSS)

      Example:
      document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px"; 
      
      [Code](https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GMWGWHQ5QB2W)

* JavaScript Can Hide HTML Element
Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the display style:

         Example
         document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none"; )
         
         [Code](https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GMWH2H6G3QVJ)
         
* JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements
Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style:

         Example
         document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block"; 
         
         [Code](https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GMWH46SR4YUS)
         

## Did You Know?
JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
