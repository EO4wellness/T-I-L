## [Overview](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1082/2782/5928/1) 
1.1 What is jQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler.

All the power of jQuery is accessed via JavaScript, 
so having a strong grasp of [JavaScript]() is essential for understanding, structuring, and debugging your code. 

Quiz: 
What is jQuery
Choices: 
- JS Function
- Programming Language
- JS Library (my answer) 

First, let's take a look at an example HTML manipulation with JavaScript.
To get the element with the id="start" and change its html to "Go" we will need to do the following:
```
var el = document.getElementById("start");
el.innerHTML = "Go";
```

To do the same manipulation with jQuery, we need just a single line of code:
```
$("#start").html("Go");
```
You will learn about the new syntax in the coming lessons, 
but as you can see, the code is much shorter and easier to understand.
Another great advantage of jQuery is that you do not need to
worry about browser support, your code will run exactly the same in all major browsers, 
including Internet Explorer 6!

Quiz: Fill in the blanks to change the elements HTML to "Test" using pure JavaScript.
```
var e = document.getElementById('test');
 e  .innerHTML  =  "Test";
 ```
