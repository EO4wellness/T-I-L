# [Regular Expressions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#regular-expressions)
Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.

In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.

This section contains 33 sections and coding challenges

positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.
