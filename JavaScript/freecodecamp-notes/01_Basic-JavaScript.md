# Basic JavaScript 
    
## Comment Your JavaScript Code 
* Comments in JavaScript are either one line or multiple lines. 
* a one line comment follows this formatting:

		// This is a one-line comment
		
* a multiple line comment always begins wwith "/*" and ends with "*/"

		/* this is a 
		multiple line
		comment */
		
* The best practice when writing comments is to use them often within your code. 
* Comments help others (on your team), yourself (debugging), and your future self figure out what each portion of code was intended to do and why you're doing it.
