# Basic JavaScript 
    
## Comment Your JavaScript Code 
* Comments in JavaScript are either one line or multiple lines. 
* a one line comment follows this formatting:

		// This is a one-line comment
		
* a multiple line comment always begins wwith "/*" and ends with "*/"

		/* this is a 
		multiple line
		comment */
		
* The best practice when writing comments is to use them often within your code. 
* Comments help others (on your team), yourself (debugging), and your future self figure out what each portion of code was intended to do and why you're doing it.

## [Declare JavaScript Variables](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-javascript-variables)
* DATA - is anything which is meaningful to the computer. 
* JavaScript has 8 different data types.
*  JavaScripte Data Types:

	undefined
	null
	boolean
	string
	symbol
	bigint
	number 
	object 
* STRINGS - are collections of characters 
* A mathematical operation can be performed on a number, but not on a string.
* VARIABLES - allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic way.
* Computers use a label to point to the data, rather than using the data its self.
* All 8 of the data types can be stored in a variable. 
* Variables are similar to the "X" or "Y" variables used in mathematics.
* Variables are a simple name which represent the data we want to refer to
* Computer variables are different than math variables as they can store different values at different times.
* We declare or create a JavaScript variable by butting the keyword "VAR" in front of it. 

	Example:
	var ourName; 
	
* The above Example code creates a VARIABLE called OurName
* In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons, as shown in the example above
* VARIABLE names can be made up of numbers, letters, $ or _
* VARIABLE names cannot contain spaces or start with a number 

	Code Assignment: Use VAR to create a variable called mnName

## [Storing Values with the Assignment Operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator)
* in JavaScript you can store information in a variable using the assignment operator. 
* the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR is the = symbol. 
* Example: 

		myVariable = 5; 
		this assigns the number value of 5
		to the variable named myVariable 
		
* if there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator. 

		Example:
		
		var myVar; 
		myMar = 5;
		
* The above example code creates a variable named myVar
* it then assigns 5 to the myVar variable 
* if myVar occurs anywhere else in the code, it will now treat it as if it were 5 (unless it is changed)
*	CODE ASSIGNEMENT:
		assign the value 7 to the variable a
