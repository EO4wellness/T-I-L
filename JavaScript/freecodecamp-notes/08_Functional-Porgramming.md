* Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. 
* In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, 
* basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.
* In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming 
* including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and 
* how to write cleaner code with methods like ```.map()``` and ```.filter()```.

## 01 [Learn About Functional Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/learn-about-functional-programming)
* Notes: 
* Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, 
* without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT
* Functional programming is about:
```
    Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

    Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

    Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled
```
* The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.
* Coding Assingment: In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC variable.

## 02 [Understand Functional Programming Terminology](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/understand-functional-programming-terminology)
* Notes: 
```
The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea. General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.

With that information, we'll need to revisit the getTea function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify getTea to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares. This makes getTea more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.

But first, let's cover some functional terminology:

Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.
```
* Coding Assignment: Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.
