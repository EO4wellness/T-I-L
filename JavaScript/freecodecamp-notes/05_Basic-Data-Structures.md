# Basic Data Structures:
* Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. 
* We aready know some common JavaScript data structures: namely arrays and objects.
* In this basic Data Structures segment of the course, we're going to learn morea bout the differences
* between arrays and objects
* which of these to use in different situations 
* we will also learn JS methods like ```splice()``` and ```Object.keys()``` to access and manipulate data
