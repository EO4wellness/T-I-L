# ES6
* This section has 31 coding challenges. 
* ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. 
* Because all major browsers follow this specification, 
* the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.
* Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), 
* which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, 
* JavaScript is always evolving, and new features are released every year.
* ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language.
* In this course, you'll learn these new features, including let and const, 
* arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules.


## [Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/explore-differences-between-the-var-and-let-keywords)
* One of the biggest problems with declaring variables 
* with the var keyword is 
* you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.
```
var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper);
```
* Here the console will display the string David.
* As you can see in the code above, 
* the camper variable is originally declared as James 
* and then overridden to be David. 
* In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem, 
* but when your code becomes larger, 
* you might accidentally overwrite a variable 
* that you did not intend to overwrite. 
* Because this behavior does not throw an error, 
* searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.
* A new keyword called ```let```
* was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue
* with the var keyword. 
* If you were to replace ```var``` with ```let``` 
* in the variable declarations of the code above, 
* the result would be an error.
```
let camper = 'James';
let camper = 'David';
```
* This error can be seen in the console of your browser. 
* So unlike var, when using let,
* a variable with the same name can only be declared once. 
* Note the "use strict". 
* This enables Strict Mode, 
* which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. 
* For instance:
```
"use strict";
x = 3.14;
```
* This will display an error that x is not defined.
* Code Assignement: Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.


## [Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/compare-scopes-of-the-var-and-let-keywords)
* 

When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

For example:

var numArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);

Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.

With the var keyword, i is declared globally. So when i++ is executed, it updates the global variable. This code is similar to the following:

var numArray = [];
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);

Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.

This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the i variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global i variable.
```
var printNumTwo;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
```
Here the console will display the value 3.

As you can see, printNumTwo() prints 3 and not 2. This is because the value assigned to i was updated and the printNumTwo() returns the global i and not the value i had when the function was created in the for loop. The let keyword does not follow this behavior:
```
let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
console.log(i);
```
Here the console will display the value 2, and an error that i is not defined.

i is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope. It is only declared within the for loop statement. printNumTwo() returned the correct value because three different i variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2) were created by the let keyword within the loop statement.

* Code Assignement: 

Fix the code so that i declared in the if statement is a separate variable than i declared in the first line of the function. Be certain not to use the var keyword anywhere in your code.

This exercise is designed to illustrate the difference between how var and let keywords assign scope to the declared variable. When programming a function similar to the one used in this exercise, it is often better to use different variable names to avoid confusion.



## [Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/declare-a-read-only-variable-with-the-const-keyword)
* The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables.
* In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.
* const has all the awesome features that let has, 
* variables declared using const are read-only. 
* They are a constant value, 
* which means that once a variable is assigned with const, 
* it cannot be reassigned.
```
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";
```
*  The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.
*  As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with const will throw an error. 
*  You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. 
*  This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant. 
*  A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.
* Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). In a later challenge you will see an example of a lowercase variable identifier being used for an array.
* Code Assignement: Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.


## [Mutate an Array Declared with const](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/mutate-an-array-declared-with-const)
* The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.
* Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.
* However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.
```
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3];
s[2] = 45;
console.log(s);
```
* s = [1, 2, 3] will result in an error. 
* The console.log will display the value [5, 6, 45].
* As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 45]. Like all arrays, the array elements in s are mutable, but because const was used, you cannot use the variable identifier s to point to a different array using the assignment operator.

* Code Assignement: An array is declared as const s = [5, 7, 2]. Change the array to [2, 5, 7] using various element assignments.


## [Prevent Object Mutation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/prevent-object-mutation)
* As seen in the previous challenge, 
* const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. 
* To ensure your data doesn't change, 
* JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze 
* to prevent data mutation.
* Once the object is frozen, 
* you can no longer add, update, or delete properties from it. 
* Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected 
* without an error.
```
let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj);
```
* The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors,
*  and the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.
*  note that's capital O in Object.freeze()

* Code Assignement:  In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able to alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties.


## [Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/use-arrow-functions-to-write-concise-anonymous-functions)
* In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

To achieve this, we often use the following syntax:
```
const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
```
ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow function syntax:
```
const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
```
When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:

``` const myFunc = () => "value"; ```
This code will still return the string value by default.

* Code Assignement: Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax. Also, make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.

```
var magic = function() {
  return new Date();
};
```
becomes:
```
const magic = () => new Date();
```

## [Write Arrow Functions with Parameters](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/write-arrow-functions-with-parameters)
* 
* Code Assignement: Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.
