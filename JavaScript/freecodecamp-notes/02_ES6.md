# ES6
* This section has 31 coding challenges. 
* ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. 
* Because all major browsers follow this specification, 
* the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.
* Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), 
* which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, 
* JavaScript is always evolving, and new features are released every year.
* ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language.
* In this course, you'll learn these new features, including let and const, 
* arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules.
