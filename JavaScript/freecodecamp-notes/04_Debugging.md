# [Debugging](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#debugging)
* Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.
* Issues in code generally come in three forms: 
- syntax errors that prevent your program from running, 
- runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, 
- or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.
* In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs 
* and prevent common issues before they happen.
