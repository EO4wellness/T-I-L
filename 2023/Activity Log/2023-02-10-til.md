Today I:

Continued learning / reviewing with the AWS ML course. 
The section I'm on is about the 5 Steps of ML. 
2.1 Intro
2.2 Define the Problem 
2.3 Build the Dataset
2.4 Model Training 

I reviewed these and newly studied 2.3 and 2.4. today. 
I also took a look at some blog articles and the AWS Deep Racer student league competition for this month to think about building and training a reinforcement model for the competition ss a learning tool.
