Today I decided to rejoin Daily Dev after a bit of a break from tech studies.  Daily Dev is an easy tool!  It is an aggrigator of articles and news about various areas of Tech News and Tutorials/How To Do that you can use to supercharge your knowledge and more easily keep up to date by customizing it with what you are interested in reading about. 

Today I read: 
* I took some time looking at the [Microsoft BioGPT github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BioGPT).  While I knew about OpenAI's ChatGPT, and have been playing around with it to see what it can do and understand its unique quirks (and there are many) I hadn't heard of Microsoft's BioGPT, so I did a Google search to see what I could learn about it.  It is relatively new.  It only recently became available.  Long ago I started a course at Udacity about genetics to try to come up to speed with where DNA studies are at.  If I decide to take a deeper dive into Microsoft's BioGPT, I'd likely re-work the Udacity course and research more about gentics and synthetic DNA. 
* I also took a look at (KD Nuggets ChatGPT resource)[https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/01/chatgpt-cheat-sheet.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-chatgpt-cheat-sheet]

(GIT MD Review)[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links]: I also refreshed my memory about Git Markdown.  I'd forgotten if the links were make in MD by '( topic ) [ Link ]' or the other way around.
