* I started this course in 2018. 
* I didn't finish the course. 
* The course was updated. 
* Today (2021-05-26) I reset my progress in this course to ZERO so I could start again with the new coursework included too.
* SoloLearn Course link: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1073 
* Learn Python, one of today's most in-demand programming languages on-the-go! 
* Practice writing Python code, collect points, & show off your skills now!

## Basic Concepts (8 Units of Study) 
### 1.1 Welcome to Python! 
* we begin by writing our first code
* it uses the '''print ()''' function 
* Example: 
```
print('Hello world!')
```
* Note that the text should be enclosed into single or double quotes. 
* The print statement needs to be followed by parentheses, which enclose the output we want to generate.

QUIZ: Finish this code to output "Hi" 
``` print("Hi")```

* The print statement can also be used to output multiple lines of text. 
* Python code often contains references to the comedy group Monty Python. 
* This is why the words, "spam" and "eggs" are often used as placeholder variables in Python.
```
print('Hello world!')
print('Hello world!')
print('Spam and eggs...')
```

QUIZ: arange the code to generate the following output: A /n B /n C
```
print("A")
print("B")
print("C")
```

### 2.1 Why Python 
Python is a high-level programming language, with applications in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence!

It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney.
In this course we will be learning Python version 3, which is the most recent major version of Python.

QUIZ: Python is a:
- set of editing tools
- develoopment environment 
- programming language (correct answer) 

Why Python?


There are almost no limitations on what can be built using Python. These include standalone apps, web apps, games, data science and machine learning models, and much more.

To use Python, you first need to install it on your computer. In our course, you will be able to run, save, and share your Python code on our Code Playground without installing any additional software.
Fun fact: According to the creator Guido Van Rossum, the name of Python was derived from the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".

QUIZ: Can Python be used in Machine Learning?
Yes! 


### 3.1 Simple Operations 
* Python has the capability of carrying out calculations.
* Enter a calculation directly into the print statement:
* Examples: 
```
print(2 + 2)
priint(5 + 4 -3)
```
* The spaces around the plus and minus signs here are optional (the code would work without them), 
* but they make it easier to read.

QUIZ: What does this code output? 
```
print(1 + 2 +3)
```
6

* Python also carries out multiplication and division, 
* using an asterisk * to indicate multiplication 
* and a forward slash / to indicate division.
* Use parentheses to determine which operations are performed first.
* Examples: 
```
print( 2 * (3 + 4) ) 
print( 10 / 2 )
```
* these examples output, respectively, 14 and 5.0 (divsion produces a float) 
* Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it is called in programming). 
* We'll have more about floats in the next lesson.

Quiz: 
which option is output by this code? 
``` print((4+8)/2)```
- 6.0 (correct answer) 
- 6
- 8
