# A Brief History
Python, is a widely used programming language.  Python has 3 major versions.  The current version in usei s Python 3.  Python 3 is not backwards compatible with earlier versions of Python.  Those learning Python should use version 3.  Generally speaking, unless you have old files in earlier versions, the older versions of Python are needed. Python was created by Guido Van Rossum.  Gudio Van Rossum noted the name "Python" was derived from the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".

# Using Python 
To use Python, you must first install it. I've had my download set up since 2019-Dec. 
* [Python Download and Installation Instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/)<br>
* [Download Python for various OS](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)<br>
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)<br>
* Windows 10 Installation: 
 - Type "Python" in the windows search window.  
 - It will take you to the windows 10 Python app store
 - signin to your microsoft account if you aren't already signed in
 - download
 - after download completes, select which windows10 device(s) you want python available upon 
* Running Python (Windows 10): 
- Type ```Windows-Key + r``  to open the run command
- Next, type ```cmd``` and hit ```OK``` (to enter) 
- type ```python``` and it will load python for us to use 
- NOTE: we know we have "python" loaded if we see ```>>>``` instead of normal CMD display for the cursor area
- you can now type and run any python script you would wish such as: 
``` 
>>> 2 + 4

then press the enter key 
 
this outputs:
6
>>>
``` 
or try some script such as: 
```
>>> print("Hello world!")
press the enter key 

The output: 
Hello world!
>>>
```
- when you are finished, exit python and return to CMD by typing 
  ``` >>> quit() ```
* IDLE: Integraded Development and Learning Environement (built-in to Python) 
- To find IDLE do the following in Windows10
- Go to Windows search
- Type IDLE
- Paste a shortcut to the software (to your course project folder, to your desktop, to startmenu, or to taskbar)--as we will be using it a lot.

# Use Cases 
Python 3 is widely used and has many use-cases spanning multiple business, programming, and hobby applications. 

# Projects
There is no way to learn code other than getting experience coding.  Here are some places to gain that experience and some projects to give a try when I finish learning Python basics.
