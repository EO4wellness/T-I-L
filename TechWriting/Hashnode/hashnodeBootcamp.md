* What is Tech Writing?  
" Technical writing is a type of writing where the author is writing about a particular subject that requires direction, instruction, or explaination.  It is an efficient and clear way of explainng something and how it works." 
* Tech Writers myths: 
- "Born or made a tech writer" - Most session attendees said 'made' or both. 
   If you were born with the most amazing skill set in something, no one--including
   you will know it if you do not make or create the opportunity to find out. 
   Even the most skilled person, can improve. 
   Even the person with no skills can learn. 
- "Do not share your thoughts" no one will know them. 
- "Short form is okay".  When people stop using "u" for "you" their writing gets better. 
* Start: open google docs or hashnode and start writing 
* Skills Needed: 
  - Writing: writing and technical writing are quite different. Writing is a way to put down your thoughts.  Technical writing is a way to organize your thoughts and give directions. You must understand how to write before writing clear technical writing instructions. 
  - Audience Perception: Understand who you are writing to (beginner, advanced, etc) 
  - Technical Skill set: you have to have skills in order to write about them. 
  - Research (skills, answers, truth) 
  - Have a Unique voice: don't lose yourself in the process.  personality matters. 
* How to identify your audience? 
- What do they need? 
- What will they be reading? 
- When will they be reading? 
- Why will they be reading? 
- How will they be reading? 
* Until you can explain it to a child, you don't know it well enough yet yourself.
* Get started:

- Read. "Read a thougsand books, and your words will flow like a river" Lisa See
