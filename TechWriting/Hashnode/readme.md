* Super excited to attend #hashnodebootcamp however it seems their a bit understaffed at the moment (no doubt due to covid complications) as I'm not able to post and tech support wasn't able to reply to my request(s) for help.  If you cannot post a blog article, you cannot participate in the ongoing bootcamp assignments.  Its a shame as the organizers did a FABULOUS job pulling this awesome event together!
