/* In PHP code, a comment is a line that is not executed as part of the program. 
# You can use comments to communicate to others so they understand what you're doing, 
# or as a reminder to yourself of what you did. 
# 
# You can have as many, or as few, comments to your code as you desire. 
# 
# A single-line commment starts with "//" 
# 
# For Example: 
*/

<?php   
    echo "<p>Hello World!</p>";
    // This is a single-line comment
    echo "<p>I am learning PHP!</p>";
    echo "<p>This is my first program!</p>";
