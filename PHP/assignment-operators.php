# Assignment operators are used to write values to variables.
#
# Example code:
<?php
$num1 = 5;
$num2 = $num1; 
?> 
# $num1 and numb2 now contain the value of 5.
# end example  
# 
# Assignment |is the same as |and does: 
# x+=y | x = x+y | Addition 
# x-=y | x = x-y  | Subtraction 
# x*=y  | x = x*y | Multiplication 
# x/=y  | x = x/y | Division 
* x%=y  | x = x%y | Modulus 
#

<?php
    $x = 50;
    $x += 100;
    echo $x; //150
?> 

# Quiz: What output results from the following code?
# <?php 
# $a = 7; $b = 3; 
# $a += $b;
# echo $a; 
# ?>
# Solution-this is the same as addition so the resulting answer is 10
