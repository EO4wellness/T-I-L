# My PHP Learning Chronicles

PHP is the very first folder I've created on GitHub within an existing folder-so to start this section, I first needed to learn how.  Many people wonder this so I wrote a WIKI describing the process found here [How to Create a Folder on GitHub](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/wiki/GitHub#create-a-folder)


## About PHP 
* PHP is a server-side scripting language. 
* PHP is primarily used in web-based applications. 
* PHP can be used for a lot of different tasks and functions. 
* PHP files use the .php (dot-PHP) file extension type. 
* PHP is a plain-text file. Therefore if you download a .php file from your server, onto your local machine, you can safely change the ".php" extenion to ".txt" and open it to view, read, or edit it using any basic text editing software. However, it must be resaved with the ".php" file extension to be executable upon re-upload to the server. 

## Resources 
So are you ready to learn PHP too?  Here is the journey I took to begin learning PHP.

### [Solo Learn Website](https://www.sololearn.com/Play/PHP)
One of the many cool things about learning code with Solo Learn is their [code playground](https://code.sololearn.com/#html) where you can experiment with the code you are learning.  
* Began learning PHP with Sololearn website. 
* My [Solo Learn profile](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/15619122)
* Completed the first module, Basic PHP Syntax, on Nov 25, 2020. 
* Continued learning, completing the second module, PHP variables, on 11/29/2020.
* Next?  In Module 3 I'll be learning about Operators, at my next PHP learning session. . .

### [PHP Snippets Folder](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/PHP)
This folder contains the code snippets in the order I learned them (commented): 
1. [PHP Header](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/PHP/php-heading.php)
2. [echo command](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/PHP/echo.php)
