# This code snippet displays details and examples of the use of arithmetic operators. 
#
# What is an operator? # Operators carry out operations on variables and values. 
#
# For example: In the math sentence:  1 + 2 = 3;  1 is an operand, + is an operator, 2 is an operand, = is an operator, and 3 is an operand

<?php
  $num1 = 8;
  $num2 = 6;
  
  //Addition
  echo $num1 + $num2; //14
  
  //Subtraction 
  echo $num1 - $num2; //2 
  
  //Multiplication
  echo $num1 * $num2: //48
  
  //Division
  echo $num1 / $num2; //1.33333333333
  
  //Modulus 
  each $num1 % $num2; //>2
