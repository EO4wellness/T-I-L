## Intro-Soceity Runs on INformation Flows 
* Information Flows are every where 
* grant access to personal information to obtain what your looking for
* examples: credit card info to purchase, heart rate for health data, etc. 
* begin with current understanding to learn how it will change in the near future 

## What is  information flow 
https://youtu.be/V2Da5Qpcv0c
* Improving information flow is important to everyone
* "information flow" 
* sender-message-receriver 
* any one else reading it
* receiver forwards
* servers along the way, reading or not reading

Quiz:
What is the best definition of an information flow?
:clap: a flow of bits from a sender to receiver with some probability
:wrong: a message froma  group of senders
:wrong: a message from a sender to receiver 

## The PrivacyDilema 
https://youtu.be/5Ql4rUS6wXs
Privacy trade off 
* Leaky Information
* Societies determine laws about this
* WHat is and what isn't a leak 
* What is private to you? 
* Is my face private?
* Is my location private? 
* Google Maps Street View 
* Helen Nissenbaum Contextual Integrity 
* Helen found the recording of public information changes the information flow 
* Privacy is appropriate flow of information 
* social rules and life-long (historically)
* how to be a good friend
* contex maters when sharing information 
* we grow up with a basic understanding of what is appropriate
* we grow up with an idea of why it is imporant 
* society modesty 
* privacy is equated with secrecy but it isn't enough with today's tech world
* achieve appropriate information control/flow 
* what's appropriate for any given conext
* enfourcement? 

Quiz:
* What is the most accurate definition of privacy?
 - the ability to hide information not already revealed - especially personal information
 - the ability to control how information is used - especially sensitive information
 - the ability to ensure flows of information which satisfy social norms
   This is the correct definition!
 - the ability to hide potentially harmful information

* When are you working with private data?
  - when the data is about a private area of someone's life
  - When somebody potentially might care (now or in the future) about how yu might use the data
    Correct - because privacy is about the flow of information in context of social norms.
  - when the data meets a local law's definition of privacy (such as GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## Lesson 2: Data is Fire 
https://youtu.be/eyqb9B2lLUE
* data can be used unlimited
* once you have it, you can share it with anyone ever
* people can be damaged by it if they aren't used wrongly
* data as fire doesn't involve: safe or dangerous
* use case matter too 
* infering 
* life changes 
* machine learning inferances 
* data can be stored for decades
* even anonomous data can be taken advantage
* analytical tools (extracting sensitive info from seeminly non-sensitive data)
* national security implications
* group / community / business implications 
* unmet marketing need
* demand
* collaboration requires sharing info/data 
* onprem cloud
* whats app
* cost human progress ? 
* unforseen costs (research, etc)
* leaky information flows-social costs 


Quiz:
Why is data "like fire"?

because it's dual use

because it can be copied and shared an infinite number of times

because it can help us prosper

because it can cause irreparable harm
Correct answer

all of the above

Is a record of whether someone buys bread private data

No - it's bread - nobody cares
Correct answer

Yes, it could be

Correct - because even seemingly trivial things like whether or not you buy bread can be used to predict sensitive things in your life.

If I had a list of whether people like movies - and I replace their names with random names -could it still be private/sensitive data?
Correct answer

Yes

Correct - this data could still contain private information, be used to infer private information, or be used to reveal private information contained in other datasets.
No

If I can't link anonymized data to someone's exact identity - could it still be considered sensitive/private information?
Correct answer

Yes, it could be

Correct - even if you can't identify an individual if you could identify a community, or have a way to target that individual, you can still use that data to cause harm.
No


## Lesson 2: The Transparency Dilemma
https://youtu.be/i7YrJU2TlbI
* Filure to accomplish important outcomes from data 
* Do not have access to the information you need to make a decsion 
* Information flow issue
* such as reviews aren't availble 
* information flow can be used to hold someone accountable 
* seeks to eliminate transparency issues 

Quiz:
What is the best definition of a transparency dilemma?

people being too transparent about information

when someone hides information to keep it secret - but is unsure of whether they should
Correct answer

when someone doesn't have access to enough information to accurately make a decision

Correct - when life doesn't have enough transparency - it creates dilemmas where people don't know what decisions to make.

## Lesson 2: The Privacy-Transparency Pareto Frontier
https://youtu.be/pVUZY_g7uEE
*  Privacy Transparency tradeoffs 
*  governement
*  business
*  personal
*  reval information or not (social good vs. harm)
*  transparency issue (doesn't have info needed to make an informed decision)
*  you can solve all transparency issues by eliminating privacy.
*  we could solve privacy issues by creating transparency issues. 
*  they are a trade off--the more we have of the one, the less we have of the other

What is the core of this course?
Correct answer

a new set of techniques which move the privacy-transparent pareto tradeoff
a robust definition of privacy
a tutorial about encryption and machine learning

#  Lesson 3: Information Flows within Communities
https://courses.openmined.org/courses/our-privacy-opportunity/15b283df-6fb3-4756-8ce6-fe268a02867c
5 Concepts 

Lesson 3: Research is Constrained by Information Flows
https://youtu.be/t7j7xAmjbk8
* Huge number of challenges
* one area: academic 
* research requires data 
* academia calls for open data practices 
* a huge amount of research/data is about people
* because of the nature of people-related data requires privacy questions to be answsered 
* researchers have a lot of rules to follow
* additionally, achieving permission to access the data may take months to obtain
* deep learing requires more data (not less)
* UK BioBank - a lot of high-quality data example
* data size
* data context 
* [Googles Medical AI was super accurate in the lab but not so accurate in real life](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/)
* Researchers want to collaborate 
* methodology matters - that requires collaboration 
* research must reflect the real population
* systems using data for good. 

## Lesson 3: Healthy Market Competition for Information Services
* email, wearable tech, websites (online)
* services involving your information are everywhere (even real world like grocery delivery)
* services that handle your data are "lock in" services.  
* Your private data is involved so the services you use aren't competitive 
* more sharing means better competition, but more risk for harm 
* user switching service (bringing data with them)
* a company thinking it has the right to sell the customer's data to a 3rd party
* 300 to 500 companies have our data 
* keep your data only where you need it
* managing your own data is impossible 
* the average person cannot do it
* data breaches are impossible to prevent
* it is a matter of time until a data breach happens with yoru data 
* erasure - the right to be forgotten 

Restricting how private data can be shared increases privacy and reduces harm

* True
* False = Correct answer 

Correct - it's extremely important that if we want to protect privacy - we need organization to be forced to share information in many cases - especially when a user wants to switch services. This allows privacy concerns to drive market competition.

Under GDPR - if you ask for your data a company has to give it to you (w/ limited exceptions)
Correct answer
True - Correct!
False

Data privacy is ONLY about preventing information from being shared in inappropriate contexts.
True
False Correct - sometimes satisfying privacy is about forcing companies to share or delete your data in a specific way or at a specific time.
