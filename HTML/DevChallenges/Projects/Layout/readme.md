# Layout Challenge 
* Each month the peeps over at CodePen.IO sponsor a [new challenge](https://codepen.io/challenges).  The latest?  
* Take this CODE (which everyone starts with) and modify it to be magazine-worthy layout. 
* Even though my studies likely do not allow me the time to work on thsi challenge now, 
* I'm saving it as I want to give it a go when I have time to focus on the challenge.
