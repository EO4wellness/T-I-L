Each month the peeps over at CodePen.IO sponsor a new challenge.  The latest?  Take this CODE (which everyone starts with) and modify it to be magazine-worthy layout. Even though my studies likely do not allow me the time to work on thsi challenge now, I'm saving it as I want to give it a go when I have time to focus on the challenge.
