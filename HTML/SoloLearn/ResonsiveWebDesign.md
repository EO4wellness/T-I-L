# SoloLearn-Responsive Web Design

# Intro: Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design is the practice of building websites that can adapt to every 
device and every screen size. During this course, we will learn how to build modern, 
responsive websites using HTML and CSS. As our course project, we will build a website
from scratch and, as a bonus, we will add some functionality to it using JavaScript at
the end of the course!

## Getting Started 
### Introduction
* Welcome to our Responsive Web Design Course!
* During this course we will learn how to build modern, 
* responsive websites using HTML and CSS.
* As our course project, we will build a real website from scratch!
* As a bonus, we will also add some functionality to the website 
* using JavaScript at the end of the course! 
* SoloLearn recommends completion of their HTML and CSS course before taking this one. 

QUIZ: 
Responsive Web Design
Complete the HTML document 

  ```
  <html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p> Hello! </p>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
  
* Responsive web design is the practice of building websites that can adapt to every device 
* and every screen size.
* A responsive website is usable on different screen sizes, 
* from large desktops to small mobile screens. 
* The main concept of responsive web design is building layouts 
* that respond to screen size change by adapting and changing the style of the page.

QUIZ:
Which of the following best describes the term Responsive Web Design?
* same layout for all screen sizes (wrong)
* consistent structure on different screen sizes (wrong: 
   same content is possible but not same structure) 
* separate pages for web and desktop (in some use cases this could be true) 
* adapting to different screen sizes (correct) 


### Course Project 
* Let's take a look at the project we will build: a generic Landing Page for an app.
This is how it will look like on a desktop:
![course-image](example_desktop-app)
* As you can see, the landing page has a number of sections:
- a header with texts and a button
- a features section
- a quote section
- a footer with a menu 
* A landing page is where users land when clicking on promotional/marketing links.
* For example, when you want to promote your app, you share its landing page URL on social
* and other media.

QUIZ: 
Course Project
Let's check your CSS knowledge.
Complete the following code to define the text color of the paragraphs.

  ```
  p {
    color: #868686;
  }
  
  ```

* Course Project
* We will create the landing page as a responsive page, 
* so it can adapt to different screen sizes.
* For example, this is how it will look on mobile:

![course-image](example_app)


* As you can see, some sections change their layouts on mobile. 
* For example, the features section 
* and the footer menu become vertical lists, 
* the download button gets wider, etc.

QUIZ: 
In HTML, fill in the blanks to define a valid image tag from the file test.png.

  ```
  
  <img src="test.png" alt="" />
  
  ```
