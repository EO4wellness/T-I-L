## [Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5)

### [Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5)
* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. 
* HTML gives structure to a web page. 
* HTML has its own syntax. 
* HTML Elments generally have open and close tags, which surround the content to give meaning to the content. 
* Historically, HTML pages generally contained static information. 
* The W3 Consortium works to ensure any browser can display HTML or HTML5 consistently. 


### [Say Hello to HTML Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/say-hello-to-html-elements)
* The course is set up to be a step-by-step guide to web develoopment. 
* To take this course, you do not need any special software or hardware: as everything you need is provided for you within the course, including the workspaces to practice code and see the results. 
* <h1>Hello</h1> is an HTML code element 
* the majority of HTML elements have an open tag, content, and then a close tag. 
* a forward slash, or in other words the keyboard item commonly on the same key as the question mark: ? / , is the only thing different about the "close" tag, than the open. 
* the first code assignment is 

        given
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        modify the code to say Hello World. 
        
        my solution:
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        

### [Headline with the h2 Element](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/headline-with-the-h2-element)
* the goal of the next few lessons, combined, is to end up wtih an HTML5 cat photo web app
* the example app will be built step-by-step, logically 
* H1 is generally used for Main Headings, where as the H2 element is generally used for subheadings. 
* additional heading elements also include H3, H4, H5, and H6
* code assignment: 

        To our existing code, 
        Add an H2 tag that says "CatPhotoApp" 
        
        my solution: 
        
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

### [Inform with the Paragraph Element](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/inform-with-the-paragraph-element)
* use "p" elements for paragraph text on a website.
* other options exist, such as just using text; however, the best/recommended practice is to set paragraphs of content on a webpage off with the P element.
* code assignement:

        Create a paragraph element to the "Hello Paragraph" content. 
        
        my solution: 
        
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
        <p>Hello Paragraph</p>

### [Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/fill-in-the-blank-with-placeholder-text)
* sometimes when we design a website, we do not know yet what the content on the page will be. we only know the general shape and function. 
* it is common for website developers to fill in an OBVIOUSLY blank text, which is meant to be useful as a placeholder while testing the function of the design, and later such blank text would be relpaced with the real content. 
* this is known as "lorem ipsum text" 
* lorem ipsum was used since 16th century by typesetters to hold the place of later inserted content. 
* to continue the traddition, yet switch it up, we will be using "Kitty" ipsum. 
* code assignment:

            Rplace the "P" text with the Kitty Ipsum text. 
            
            my solution: 
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
            <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
            <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
            

### [Uncomment HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/uncomment-html)
* leaving comments in code, is a way to help yourself and other coders decypher your code at a later date and time
* comments can also help with debugging or security issues as a comment can indicated the intented correct functioning 
* comments are not readibly visible to the person who views the webpage your coding in their browser
* in HTML comments start with the <!-- tag and close with the --> tag. 
* code assingment: 

                Uncomment this code:
                
                <!--
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
                <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
                -->
                
                my solution: 
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
                <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
                


### [Comment out HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/comment-out-html)
* apply what you know in this sections code assingment

            Uncomment just the h2 element, but comment the h1 and p elements in this code:
            <!--
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
            <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
            <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
            -->
            
            my solution 
            <!-- this comment will make the H1 element not visible
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
            -->
            <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
            <!-- this comment will make the P element not visible
            <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
            -->


### [Delete HTML Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/delete-html-elements)
* because mobile devices are so common these days
* because phones don't have much vertical space
* it is important to remove all unnecessary elements
* Code assingment:

        delete the H1 element to simplify the view 
        
        my solution: 
        <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
        <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>


### [Introduction to HTML5 Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/introduction-to-html5-elements)
* HTML5 was released October 28, 2014 after first being drafted in 2008. 
* HTML5 adds several tags.  these include:
        
            main
            header
            footer
            nav
            video
            article
            section
            ... as well as a few others ...
            
 * HTML5 tags add descriptive structure
 * this helps with SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
 * Example use case (this is the MAIN element with 2 child elements nested inside MAIN) 
 
            <main> 
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
            </main>
            
  * more about this in a later study session (below) 
  * code assignment: 
  
            create a second paragraph
            create a man element
            next the two paragraphs within the main element 
            
            my solution:
            <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
            <main>
            <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
            
            <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
            </main>


### [Add Images to Your Website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/add-images-to-your-website)
* images use the IMG element 
* the IMG element must point to a specific image URL
* the URL is pointed to using the SRC attribute 
* the IMG element is an exception to the OPEN and CLOSE tags rule of ELEMNTS 
* the IMG element is self closing
* all IMG elements must have an ALT attribute 
* the text of the ALT attribute is used for screen readers, accessiblity, and displays if the image fails to load 
* if an image is purely decorative, using an empty ALT attribute is the best practice
* ALT attributes should not contian special characters 
* example: 

        <img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg">
        
* example with ALT: 

        <img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg" alt="A business cat wearing a necktie."> 
        
* code assignement: 

            within the existing code, add this image https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat to the main element 
            
            my solution:
            <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
            <main>
            <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="two kittens playing with one another" >
            <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
            <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
            </main>
            


### [Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/link-to-external-pages-with-anchor-elements)
* A is known as an anchor element 
* anchor elements are used to link to content outside the webpage you are writing 
* because of this, all a elements need a destination 
* the desination is a web address called an HREF attribute 
* example of an anchor text: 

                <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">this links to freecodecamp.org</a>
                
                this example will display the text "this links to freecodecamp.org" as a link you can click to visit https://www.freecodecamp.org
                
* code assingment: 

        create an A element that links to this website and has "cat photos as its anchor text. 
        
        my solution:
        <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
        <main>
        <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
        <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>
        <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
        <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
        </main>
        

### [Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/link-to-internal-sections-of-a-page-with-anchor-elements)
* the A (anchor) element isn't just useful for links to other pages or websites
* the Anchor element can also jump to different regions within the same webpage which are called internal links
* to create an internal link you will need to assign the HREF attribute a hash (number) symbol but the value of the ID for the element you want to jump to (usually further down the page) 
* an ID attribute uniquely describes an element 
* code assignement 

            change the external link in our code to an internal link with the "#footer" attribute
            change the text "cat photos" to "Jump to Bottom" 
            remove the target="_blank" attribute
            add the ID attrivbute with a value of FOOTER to the <footer> element 
            
            my solution 
            <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
            <main>
            <a href="#footer">Jump to Bottom</a>
            <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
            <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched. Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
            <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched. Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
            <p>Meowwww loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it yet spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch or lay on arms while you're using the keyboard. Missing until dinner time toy mouse squeak roll over. With tail in the air lounge in doorway. Man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail.</p>
            <p>Intently stare at the same spot poop in the plant pot but kitten is playing with dead mouse. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot leave fur on owners clothes meow to be let out and mesmerizing birds leave fur on owners clothes or favor packaging over toy so purr for no reason. Meow to be let out play time intently sniff hand run outside as soon as door open yet destroy couch.</p>
            </main>
            <footer id="footer">Copyright Cat Photo App</footer>

### [Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/nest-an-anchor-element-within-a-paragraph)
* links can be nested within other text elements
* example: 

                <p>Here's a <a target="_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.org"> link to freecodecamp.org</a> for you to follow.</p>
                
* the course outlines a description of what each part of the code above does, function wise
* code assignment:
        
            nest the existing a element withi a new p element 
            have the new P text saying "View more cat photos"
            
            my solution:
            <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
            <main>
            <p> View more cat photos
            <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>
            <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
            </p>
            <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
            <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
            </main>
            


### [Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/make-dead-links-using-the-hash-symbol)
* what happens in web design when you know a link will be placed on the page, but you don't yet know what the link will be, or you haven't yet received/made the content page you are going to link to? 
* later in our studies, we will see this is also really useful/helpful when we use JAVA SCRIPT 
* code assignment

            currently the HREF attribute value is "https://freecatphotoapp.com"
            repalce it with a # (which is also known as the HASH or NUMBER symbol.  This will create a dead link. 
            example: href="#" 
            
            my solution:
              <p>Click here to view more <a href="#" target="_blank">cat photos</a>.</p>


### [Turn an Image into a Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/turn-an-image-into-a-link)
* make an element into a link by nesting them within an "A" element 
* to next an image you can do likewise 
* here is an example: 

                <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera."></a>
                
* code assignement

                use the # as the href property to turn this into a dead link, but make the image on your page a link
                
                my solution: 
                  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
                  
* at the sucessful completion of this code assignement, this portion of the course is 50% completed 

### [Create a Bulleted Unordered List](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/create-a-bulleted-unordered-list)
* there is an element to create lists. 
* lists can be "unordered" if they have a butteted point style instead of numbers
* unordered lists star with the open element of <ur> plus as many <li> elements as needed and closed with the </ul>
* the LI (list) items should be in the format of: <li>content</li>
* for example, if you were attempting to make, in HTML, a list of grocery shopping items or even recipe ingredients you could do so like this: 

                <ul>
                <li>milk</li>
                <li>cheese</li>
                <li>...as many more items as needed to complete your list..</li>
                </ul>
                
 * code assignement
 
                remove the last two P elements from our code 
                create an unordered list of 3 things that cats love
                place this list at the bottom of the page. 
                
                my solution 
                <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
                <main>
                <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
                <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

### [Create an Ordered List](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/create-an-ordered-list)
* the other way to make lists is numbered, or also known as an ordered list
* ordered lists open with <ol> followed by any number of <li> elements and closed by </ol>
* code assignement 

                make a list of the top 3 things cat hate the most 
                
                my solution:

### [Add a Submit Button to a Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/add-a-submit-button-to-a-form)
* a SUBMIT button is used in conjunction with the form 
* the button element is NOT self-closing 
* clicking the button will send the data from the input field to the URL we specified in the ACTION attribute 
* example: 

                <button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>
                
* code assignement 

                add a button to the last element of your form 
                use the type of submit
                use submit as the text 
                
                my solution:

### [Use HTML5 to Require a Field](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/use-html5-to-require-a-field)
* input can be required so that a form cannot be submitted without first filling in the required information. 
* use the REQUIRED attribute within an INPUT element to require your website visitors to complete a field. 
* for example 

                <input type="text" required> 
                
* code assignement 

               make the text input field required 
               test the function of your field
               try to submit without entering the information
               what happens? 
               
               my solution: 
               <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo"> 
               <input type="text" required placeholder="cat photo URL">
               <button type="submit">Submit</button>
               </form>
               
               my test: 
               I was thrilled this first assingment told me to test the results! 
               I believe in testing even the most simple thing. 
               Even cut-n-paste errors are common and cause broken links. 
               When I attempted to submit my form without entering anything 
               the form gave me the pop out error message of: "Please fill out this field." 
               
               


### [Create a Set of Radio Buttons](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/create-a-set-of-radio-buttons)
* do you want your website visitors to give answers from a specific set of answers? 
* achieve this by using radio buttons
* Radio Buttons are a type of INPUT 
* Radio Buttons can each be nested within its own label element.
* Radio Button input will automatically be associated with its label element if you wrap it inside the label element. 
* Radio Buttons need name attributes 
* using this design option, when you select any one of the buttons, the others are deselected 
* best practices: set a FOR attribute on the LABEL element to match the value of the ID in the INPUT
* code assignement 

                add a pair of radio buttons to our form
                nest each radio button with its own label 
                options: indoor, outdoor 
                name attribute of indoor-outdoor
                create a radio group 
                
                my solution: 
                <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
                <label for="indoor"> 
                <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor 
                </label>
                <label for="outdoor"> 
                <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor 
                </label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
                </form>


### [Create a Set of Checkboxes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/create-a-set-of-checkboxes)
* besides radio buttons, we could also use the design element of checkboxes. 
* checkboxes differ from radio buttons in that you can select more than one checkbox for an answer, whereas with radio buttons you must chose one or another, but not more than one. 
* checkboxes are a type of input
* checkboxes can be nested 
* when wrapped in an input element inside a label element it will automatically be associated with the checkbox input with the lable element which surrounds it 
* all of the related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute 
* define the relationship between a checkbox input and it corresponding label by setting the FOR attribute on the label element to match the ID attribute of the associated INPUT element 
* checkbox example: 

        <label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
        
* code assignement 

                add 3 checkboxes to our form 
                each checkbox should be nested within its own label element 
                name all 3 PERSONALITY 
                
                my solution 
                
                  <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
                  <label for="indoor"><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
                  <label for="outdoor"><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
                  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required><br>
                  <label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
                  <label for="spunky"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Spunky</label>
                  <label for="Troublesome"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Troublesome</label><br>
                  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
                  </form>
                


### [Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/use-the-value-attribute-with-radio-buttons-and-checkboxes)
* when a website visitor uses the "submit" button we've created, then the information they entered gets sent to the server, including the options they selected in any radio or check boxes. 
* if a value for each of the radio options isn't unique within the coding, then the information your website visitor submitted would default to "on" (for the entire radio group), meaing you wouldn't be able to tell which of the options your website visitor actually selected. 
* thus, the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option
* code assignement 

                assign each of the radio and checkbox inputs the VALUE attribute 
                use the input label text, in lower case, for the value attribute

### [Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/define-the-head-and-body-of-an-html-document)
* HTML pages can have yet another level of organization: HEAD and BODY elements
* markup about the page would be included in the HEAD 
* the page content is included within the BODY
* METADATA elements such as link, meta, title, and style are generally used for SEO and are located within the HEAD element
* example overall page layout 

                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <head>
                        <!-- metadata elements -->
                </head>
                <body>
                        <!-- page contents -->
                </body>
                </html>


* code assignement 

                edit the given markup
                add a head and a body 
                the head element should only include the title
                the body element should contain the H1 and P elements
                
                my solution: 
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <head>
                <title>The best page ever</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                <h1>The best page ever</h1>
                <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. I like big cats and i can not lie kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Meow i could pee on this if i had the energy for slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish yet scamper. Knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish scratch the furniture.

## Course Completion
Upon completion of the course, you receie a "100% bar" scrolling to show you've completed everything in the HTML Basics coursework.  Additionally, you have a chance, if you haven't already taken it, to support the work Free Code Camp is doing. Further, you will see the [LEARN view](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) change to show you've completed this subsegment of the HTML course. You won't yet receive any type of certification(s) on your "profile" as you've not yet completed the entire learning HTML coursework, just the first basic step in the course. Additionally, the course creators recommend you continue your coding studies by [learning CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css) and offer both [a link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css) to that course content, and a pre-view of the upcoming lessons within that coursework so you can make a decision if you want to take a break for the day, or continue.  The HTML course can be done at your own pace (completed in one day or across several days/weeks).

## Course Segment Review
I already knew basic HTML so for me, this part of the course was *too basic* but, having said that, it was indeed very logical and easy to follow.  The only thing I think which may be difficult to a beginner is the interface.  For example, the instruction on the screen says to do "control + enter" to go to the next screen.  However, since the user interface is designed (very brilliant design, by the way) to look like a code editor (not a normal website interace) after you've switched screens it would be possible for some individuals, not to notice the screen changed. If I had not made an outline for taking notes about this course, for example, to which I could refer back to, I may not have noticed the topics were changing after I did the step as prompted.  Visually the screen looked nearly identical EXCEPT for that heading text--then as I read further down the page-I realized it was the next lesson, not the one I assumed (incorrectly) I didn't complete correctly for this website. 

Havine said that, once you are used to this quirk in design, perhaps not working as you would have expected it to visually work, it is no big deal and isn't even difficult to navigate the website--but perhaps it would have been better, given that the majority of people are visual learners, to give people a heads-up the content is going to visually change as much in this course, as it would in other websites. I think the design is brilliant because it is a combo of what they will need to be doing to code, but still functional enough to be a website experience, not a coding experience exclusively. 

Is the course too basic, if you already know some HTML?  Yes and no.  Let me explain.  I learned HTML from "view source" long ago.  If, like me, you've been using HTML for a while, this course will be EASY for you and yet still round out (potentially) some ideas and be certain you are on the same page with the rest of this course, digging into deeper concepts; while at the same time examining HTML5 elements which are relatively recently added to HTML. 

If you do not know anything at all about coding, you're going to take longer to work through these examples.  Here is why you should.  If you want to learn to code, this is a fabulous method.  By the time you are finished with this segment of code, you see practical application(s) of each of these HTML code elements, attributes, and tags. I've seen many posting on line for "help" because they are "stuck" on one or more of the code assignements.  While this could be very frustrating, and that is relatably so, this process of debugging what's gone wrong also helps you learn your errors. For example, the majority of times I coded my solutions for this course, upon the "Run the Tests" button, I was successfuly right away.  Hurray!  However, on the few times I didn't pass on to the next lesson right away, it was 100% of the time a typo on the > vs . key.  So now, after having practiced this coding session, in this course, in this lab space of their website, and using this equipment I know my typos tend to be in the close tags because I was typing too fast and the "shift" key wasn't where I thought it was while typing.  This can happen to anyone.  It is an error anyone can make.  However, it is specifically a common error I make.  Knowing this from doing my own debugging makes me look for that specific typo quickly and efficiently.  That's a great thing to know and its only obtained thru debugging. 

The Free Code Camp is a non-profit.  As such, if you are able, they request you send them a donation to keep their work free to all.  This is a worthy cause.  If you are new to coding, web hosts are not free. The time it takes to write the function of this website, isn't minor.  This website continues to build content to help others learn to code and asks nothing in return other than the occasional request for donations. Your profile with this website can be public or private in any or all aspects (name, photo, details, educational paths, certifiations, etc.)
