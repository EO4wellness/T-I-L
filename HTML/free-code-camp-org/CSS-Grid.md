* Began studies: 2021-03-16
* The CSS grid is a newer standard that makes it easy to build complex responsive layouts. 
* It works by turning an HTML element into a grid, and lets you place child elements anywhere within.
* In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of CSS grid by building different complex layouts, including a blog.

## [Create Your First CSS Grid](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/create-your-first-css-grid)
* Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its display property to drid. 
* you can then use all the properties associated with CSS Grid. 
* Code Assignment: Change the display of the div with the container class to grid.

## [Add Columns with grid-template-columns](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/add-columns-with-grid-template-columns)
* just creating a grid element, doesn't do much on its own. 
* you need the grid structure, defined, too. 
* add some columns by using the GRID-TEMPLATE-COLUMNS property
* Example:

        .container {
          display: grid;
          grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
        }
        
* the above example codes, results in 2 columns which are each 50 px wide.
* the number of parameters in the grid-template-columns indicates the number of columans in the grid.
* Code Assignment: Give the grid container three columns that are each 100px wide. 

## [Add Rows with grid-template-rows](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/add-rows-with-grid-template-rows)
* the last challenge grid, created the number of rows automatically
* to adjust the rows manually, use the grid-template-rows property 
* this new property can be used in the same as the previous one 
* Code Assignment: Add two rows to the grid that are 50px tall each.

## [Use CSS Grid units to Change the Size of Columns and Rows](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/use-css-grid-units-to-change-the-size-of-columns-and-rows)
* 
* Code Assignment: Make a grid with three columns whose widths are as follows: 1fr, 100px, and 2fr.

## [Create a Column Gap Using grid-column-gap](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/create-a-column-gap-using-grid-column-gap) 
* 
* Code Assignment: Give the columns in the grid a 20px gap. 

## [Create a Row Gap using grid-row-gap](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/create-a-row-gap-using-grid-row-gap)
* 
* Code Assignment: Create a gap for the rows that is 5px tall.
