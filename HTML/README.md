# HTML (learning archive)
* This Repo contains various course I've studied while learning and/or rehoning my HTML skills. 
* Originally, I learned HTML in the 1990s on a major college campus intranet.
* I originallty learned on Netscape using "View Source" and copying learning elements that way. 
* Used WordPress and other WYSIWYG tools, as well as raw coding.
* Originally, I learned HTML before there was a division into "CSS" too.

# HTML Learning Chronicles

When I first learn HTML coding it was using the Netscape (retired) browser, long before GUI, Google, or FB.  I learned it by visiting a page online which I liked, selecting "View Source" and reading the code.  A lot has changed since then.
