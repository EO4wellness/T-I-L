# Papers 
There are a lot of papers written about topics such as AI, ML, NLP (things I'm interested in keeping some-what up-to-date about, but not necessarily coding myself. I have run some notebooks and some basic AI/ML/NLP models enough to understand what I'm reading about or how things are generally working.  I haven't run enough to be any where near "experienced" let alone "expert" in this area.  Mostly, I like to know what is and isn't hype, possible, or the real status.  There is a LOT of TALK in this area of tech.
