# AI

# ML (Machine Learning) 

# NLP (Natural Laungage Processing)
This is the area of AI/ML application, which interests me the most. 

# Studies
* This "T-I-L" repository is a chronical outlining my studies in various areas of tech, although I did also add some of my learning of various spoken/written human languages, to be able to more quickly come-up-to-speed learning MD and gaining enough experience in MD to really be able to properly put text on a page, the way I wanted to format it, without having to think much about the markdown "code" to do so.
* My journey specific to learning more about machine learning and artificial intelligence came after seeing a lot of hoopla (some truthful, some wild imagination) about the topic(s).  I knew I had no clue what was currently going on in this area of tech and wanted to study enough to learn about it--be able to read a published paper about it, for example, and understand what was being dicsussed. Before I knew it, I was a Bertlesmann Tech Scholarship recipient and leraning about AI! Hurray!  Lovely experience, on a side note, and I would highly encourage anyone interested to also check it out!  
* Been reading papers since and keeping an eye on the tech news about the topic(s) of interest in this area of tech. 
* My most recent study sessions were with the [AI Demystified-a 5-day-mini-course](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/AI-ML-NLP/AI-Demystified-5-day-mini-course.png), which was very introductory, but never-the-less useful as it outlined different events I wasn't previously aware of in giving examples of each of the different types of AI. That course included some freebies to assist students such as [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/AI-ML-NLP/AI-CheatSheet.pdf) and a [Quick-Start Guide](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/AI-ML-NLP/AI-QuickStartGuide.pdf)
* I completed the [AWS study of AI](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/AI-ML-NLP/74a12846-1716-488e-bfbf-bc5d8988d856.jpg) offered [here at the Udacity website](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud090) as well as the [Amazon AWS DeepRacer - Reinforcement Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-deepracer--ud014) Udacity course.

# Papers
* I have also created a [AI/ML/NLP resource to log and record papers](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/AI-ML-NLP/reading-study-resouces.md) I've read in this topic.
