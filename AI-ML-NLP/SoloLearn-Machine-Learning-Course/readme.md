* has a Machine Learning course. 
* below are my notes from working through their course. 

# [Machine Learning Course](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1094)
In this course, sololearn promises we will learn how to create those AI systems that power modern lives.

## The Basics: 
* Covers 10 Units of Study 

### Welcome to Machine Learning 
* In the welcome, SoloLearn recommends we "take advantage of the daily tips" 
* Python is the programming language that we are going to use throughout this course.

Quiz: Welcome to Machine Learning. 
Which programming language are we going to use throughout this course?
- TypeScript
- Python (this is the correct answer)
- Java
- C/C++

### Machine Learning Overview
* Machine Learning is also often abreviated  M.L. or just ML 
* ML takes data and turns it into insights. 
* ML uses the computer's power to analyze examples from the past
* then builds a model which can predict the future results for new examples
* ML is all around us
* we see and use ML every day 
* Examples: Netflix, Amazon recommends 
* The course focuses on techniques to solve ML problems. 
* ML Examples: create a chatbot, detect spam, having image recognition 

QUIZ: Machine Learning Overview
Which of the statements are correct?
- ML is a programming language.
- ML takes data and turns it into insights (correct)
- We don't encounter ML models every day.
- Machine learning uses computer power to build models and predict future results. (correct)


### Course Basics 
* ML usually uses Python as its programming language 
* In this course we’ll use several Python packages that are helpful in solving Machine Learning problems. 
_ pandas
_ numpy
_ matplotlib
_ scikit-learn
* Pandas is used for reading data and data manipulation
* numpy is used for computations of numerical data
* matplotlib is used for graphing data
* and scikit-learn is used for machine learning models. 
* Each of these packages is quite extensive, 
* but we will review the functions we will be using. 
* We will also review some basic statistics as it is the foundation of machine learning. 
* The course will cover both the theory and practice of machine learning techniques, but will focus on how to use them on real examples.

QUIZ: Which of the following is used for reading data and data manipulation?
- Matplotlib
- Pandas (correct answer) 
- Numpy 

### What's in this Course?
* In Machine Learning, we talk about supervised and unsupervised learning. 
* Supervised learning is when we have a known target based on past data 
* (for example, predicting what price a house will sell for) 
* and unsupervised learning is when there isn't a known past answer 
* (for example, determining the topics discussed in restaurant reviews).
* In this course we'll be focusing on supervised learning. 
* Within supervised learning, there are classification and regression problems. 
* Regression is predicting a numerical value (for example, predicting what price a house will sell for) 
* and classification is predicting what class something belongs to (for example, predicting if a borrower will default on their loan).
* We'll be focusing on classification problems. 
* These are problems where we’re predicting which class something belongs to. 
* Our examples will include:
• Predicting who would survive the Titanic crash
• Determining a handwritten digit from an image
• Using biopsy data to classify if a lump is cancerous
* We'll be using a number of popular techniques to tackle these problems. We'll get into each of them in more detail in upcoming modules:
• Logistic Regression
• Decision Trees
• Random Forests
• Neural Networks
* At the end of this course, you'll be able to take a classification dataset 
* and use Python to build several different models to determine the best model for the given problem.
* Machine Learning can be used to solve a broad range of problems. 
* This course will focus on supervised learning and classification.

QUIZ: What's in this Course?
Which of the following are examples of classification problems?
- Determining if an image is of a car, bus, or bike. (correct) 
- Prediciting what price to sell an image for.
- Predicting if a credit card charge is fraudulent. (correct) 

### Statistics Review:
_Averages_
* When dealing with data, we often need to calculate some simple statistics.
* Let's say we have a list of the ages of people in a class.
* We have them in ascending order since it will be easier to do the calculations.
``` 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 24, 29, 30, 34 ```
* The mean is the most commonly known average.
* Add up all the values and divide by the number of values:
``` (15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 22 + 24 + 29 + 30 + 34) / 9 =  207/9 = 23 ```
* The median is the value in the middle. 
* In this case, since there are 9 values, the middle value is the 5th, which is 22.
* In statistics, both the mean and the median are called averages. 
* The layman’s average is the mean.

QUIZ: Averages
The following list includes the number of children that each of 5 different families have. 
Based on this information, what are the mean and median number of children per family?
0, 1, 1, 2, 6

Mean = 2 and the Median = 1
