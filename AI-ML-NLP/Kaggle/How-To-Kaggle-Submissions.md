# Kaggle Submissions: A How to Document

Assumptions: 
* To begin this tutorial guide assumes you have a completed (notebook) to submit to a Kaggle competition.  
* If you don't yet have a notebook ready for submission, 
  then you can get one by following Day 1, Day 11, or Day 12's assignment(s) for the Kaggle 30 Days of ML Challenge found in this repo. 
* If you do not yet have a competition, you can [locate one here: ](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
* You must ENROLL in a Kaggle competition before you can submit a submission to the competition 
* Steps to Enroll: 
   1. Locate the [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
   2. Click on it to view the competition. 
   3. Click on "Enroll" in the upper right corner of the competition.
