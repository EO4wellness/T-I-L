## Activities: 
* This challenge is intended to assist in developing teamwork skills 
* Also, in developing self-directed learning skills. 
* Use the dataset, other courses available at Kaggle (online) to help you and your teammates move up the leader board. 

## Use of Code: 
When viewing other people's code or notebook, you can use the “Copy and Edit” button to create your own, private notebook (only you can see it).  If you edit the code, you’re only editing your copy, and it won’t change the original notebook.  In order to make the notebooks that you write appear in the Code tab for the rest of the community, you’ll need to change the notebook settings to make the notebook public.

Whenever you find a notebook useful, you should thank the author by giving the notebook an upvote.

## Discussion
Use this tab to discuss the competition with other Kagglers.  There are three options for discussing the competition. You can:
- Chat with the entire Kaggle community by making a post in the Discussion tab, or
- Join a team and share your insights with all of your teammates, or
- Keep the information to yourself.
