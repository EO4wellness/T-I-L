# [Introduction](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/introduction)
* this is a ML micro course at the intermediate level 
* course covers how to improve the quality of ML models 
* learn to: 
  1. real-world datasets (missing values, categorical variables, etc) 
  2. design pipelines (improves quality of ML models and code) 
  3. advanced technique of model validation such as cross-validation 
  4. state-of-the-art models (XGBoost) 
  5. avoid leakage/common mistakes 
* Prerequisites to already be familiar with: 
  1. model validation 
  2. underfitting
  3. overfitting
  4. random forests 

# Exercise:

We're working now with the data from [Housing Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course)

If you need to [Review Random Forests](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests)

Lots of Jupyter Notebook cells to run without changes to prep everything before arriving at the exercises: 

## Step 1: Evaluate Several Models

### Personal Reflections: 
* WOW!  I just submitted my 3rd ever kaggle submission.  
* This is becoming a habit.  
* While the process is fresh in my mind, I'm writing it up. 
* Seems each time I submit, I forget one or more step. 
* Over time it will become familiar and habitual. 
* Until then: notes!  :)
