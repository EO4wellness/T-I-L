# Kaggle Submissions: A How to Document

Assumptions: 
* To begin this tutorial guide assumes you have a completed (notebook) to submit to a Kaggle competition.  
* If you don't yet have a notebook ready for submission, 
  then you can get one by following Day 1, Day 11, or Day 12's assignment(s) for the Kaggle 30 Days of ML Challenge found in this repo. 
* If you do not yet have a competition, you can [locate one here: ](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
* You must ENROLL in a Kaggle competition before you can submit a submission to the competition 
* Steps to Enroll: 
   1. Locate the [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
   2. Click on it to view the competition. 
   3. Click on "Enroll" in the upper right corner of the competition. 
      NOTE: If somehow you've previously enrolled this "Join Competition" button turns to "Submit Predictions" 
      These two cases are illustrated below.  
      The Join Competition example for detecting cancer, and the already enrolled example for the Titanic disaster [See Day 1]() 

Example when you still need to join the competition:

# Kaggle Competition Submission Process: 
NOTE: While all competitions have a similar submission process.  Below are the steps for submitting to any Kaggle Competition. 

1.  In your notebook, begin by clicking on the blue Save Version button in the top right corner of the window. 
2.  This will generate a pop-up window.
3.  Ensure that the Save and Run All option is selected, and then click on the blue Save button.
4.  This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook. 
5.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the Save Version button. 
6.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen. 
7.  Click on the ellipsis (...) to the right of the most recent version, and select Open in Viewer. 
8.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. 
9.  You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.
10. Click on the Output tab on the right of the screen. 
11. Then, click on the file you would like to submit, and click on the blue Submit button to submit your results to the leaderboard.
12. You have now successfully submitted to the competition!
13. If you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue Edit button in the top right of the screen. 
14. Then you can change your code and repeat the process. 
15. There's a lot of room to improve, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.
