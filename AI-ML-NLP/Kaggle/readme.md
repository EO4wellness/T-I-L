## Day 0: 30-Days Preview
```
Overview of 30 Days of ML:

30 Days of ML is designed to help you grow from non-coder → Kaggle competitor in 30 days.

In the first 2 weeks, you’ll receive hands-on assignments delivered to your inbox that rapidly cover the most essential skills needed to get your hands dirty with data.

Next, you’ll be invited to a Kaggle machine learning competition to test your knowledge. Through practice, you’ll explore the best ways to use Kaggle as a learning resource and connect with other data scientists in the Discord community.

Hope to see you there,
Alexis Cook
