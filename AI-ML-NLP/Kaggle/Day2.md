# Day 2
* Began my study session by reviewing yesterday's notes/materials. 
* Invited others to join (Twitter, LinkedIn, various AI/ML Slack Workspaces, email, what's app) 
* Checked in with Discord. 
* Muted Discord channels of no interest such as languages I don't speak.  
* Connected with peeps of interest on discord. 
* Checked my stats from yesterday's submission. 

# Start of Day 2: 
* Noticed my results were in from the competition we submitted in yesterday's studies. 
* Yesterday said to check back later for the results.  
* Here they are:

* Also there were new results of things happening on my profile.

Apparently, all Kaggle courses have harder, more challenging, questions which they designate with a chili pepper!  Here's my solution from today:

In several programming languages, I've learned about this modulo method of finding the remainder of a division problem, but until today's coding session, I'd never actually seen a practical use for it.  It was so FUN to read the problem and then go "ah ha, I know what to use!" because this "never-by-me" used before code was finally going to get used.  I did have to scroll back up the page to the image where they had Python list as I couldn't recall if I had Python in my head or JavaScript or something else.

DONE!  SUccess.  Today's lesson was fun and enjoyable.  The only issue I had was occassionally I ran a cell more than once by mistake.  No biggy.  Didn't impact the outcome. Its just me getting used to the difference between self-hosted Jupyter Notebooks and Kaggle Notebooks

Yesterday they said to do as a bonus 3 hours of study in the Kaggle Intro to Machine Learning course.  I noticed the ML Into course has the same number of lessons 
as Python, so I'm going to try to do one a day along with the Python lessons.
