## Study Notes:
* Functions we've seen ```print``` or ```abs```
* there are many more functions 
* you can even make your own 
* ```help()```
* the help function helps you when you've forgotten 
```
Example: 

help(round)

Help on built-in function round: 
round(number, ndigits=None) 
   round a number to a given precision in decimal digits
```



### help() displays two things:

    the header of that function round(number, ndigits=None). 
    In this case, this tells us that round() takes an argument we 
    can describe as number. Additionally, we can optionally give a
    separate argument which could be described as ndigits.
    
    A brief English description of what the function does.

Common Problem: 
trying to look up a function? then remember to pass in the name of the function its self
