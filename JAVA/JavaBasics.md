# CodeGym Java Basics

* Programs written in Java are executed by the Java virtual machine (JVM). 
* The JVM is a special program that knows how to execute programs written in Java.
* The list of its commands is quite extensive. 
* For example, this command could be used to display 'Robots are friends to humans' on the screen."
Here's a super simple command:
```
System.out.println("Robots are friends to humans");
```
* In the Java programming language, each command is written on its own line. 
* A semicolon must be placed at the end of a command.
* Example: 
```
Suppose we want to display 'Humans and robots are friends forever' on the screen three times. This is how it would look:"
The program is made up of three commands:

System.out.println("Humans and robots are friends forever");
System.out.println("Humans and robots are friends forever");
System.out.println("Humans and robots are friends forever");
```
