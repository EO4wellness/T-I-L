* The body of a method consists of commands. 
* We could even say that a method is a group of commands 
* that has been given a name (method name).

* The Java language has commands for every occasion. 
* Each command describes some action. 
* At the end of each command, we use a semicolon
* Example of commands

* We use parentheses to pass arguments to the command. 
* Depending on the value of the arguments, 
* the same command can execute different actions

his command has two versions: System.out.println() and System.out.print()"

* "If you use the System.out.println() command a few times, 
* youâ€™ll see that each time the text you pass to the command 
* is displayed on a separate line. 
* If you use the System.out.print() command, 
* the text is displayed on the same line. 
* For example:
