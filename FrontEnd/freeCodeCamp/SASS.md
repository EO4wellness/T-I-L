# [SASS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#sass)
* Not to be confused with SAAS
* Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. 
* It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects.
* In this Sass course, you'll learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to your styles, and more.
