Review of HTML. 
HTML is made of elements. 
review of basic features including lagnuage declaration, title, head, body, sections, tags, close tags, and such. 
Basically in boostrap we're dealing with div containers

Classes are the main bootstrap feature.  
we can use as many as needed
we should seperate each by one space in between.  here is an example

all of boostrap is laid out in 12 grid layout
but emphasis can change by how you design it.

Here is an example of one design to empahsize different content:

The built in bootstrap breakpoint sizes are anticipated to be useful for: 
xs=cell phone in portrait mode 
=cell phone in landscape mode 
=tablet 
=lap top or desk top computer views
= wider devices such as smart tvs, etc.

Best practice: start with the design with XS and then go from there. 
For most things this works best as the small screen is less complex of a design
