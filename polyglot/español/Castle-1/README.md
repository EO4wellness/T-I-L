# Duolingo Stories 
The Duolingo stories help with reading comprehension, as well as introducing new vocabularly, and additionally offer practice at speaking and listening to real language speakers (male, female, children, adults) in funny scenarios.  In addition to the fun scenarios, often with a humorous twist or otherwise amusing twist to the conclusion of the story, there are cultural pieces appropriate to the culture.  However, not every language course on DuoLingo currently has stories.
