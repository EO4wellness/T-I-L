##¡Yo no comprendo!
It's easy to make a negative statement in Spanish: simply say _no_ before the verb.

        Yo no estudio inglés. |   I don't study English.
        Lo siento. Yo no comprendo. | I'm sorry. I don't understand.
        
        
## ¡Quiero hablar español!
Escribir, estudiar, and leer are all verb forms called infinitives. 

        Yo quiero escribir. | I want to write.

In English, infinitives always have the word to at the start (like to study or to read). But in Spanish, they don't require any extra words. To say I want to study, you'd just say Yo quiero estudiar. 

        Yo necesito leer. | I need to read.
