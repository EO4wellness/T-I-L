## Happy endings
* The basic form of a verb is called an infinitive. 

        For example,
        hablar (to speak), 
        comer (to eat), 
        and escribir (to write) 
        are all infinitives.
        
* Spanish has three verb groups: verbs ending in ‑ar, ‑er, or ‑ir. 
* These are the ending patterns for each group.
