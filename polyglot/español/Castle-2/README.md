* Castle 2 Final Quiz 

NOTE: I originally completed all five levels in ach of the Castle 2 categories listed above, back before the end of 2019.  Now, I'm only reviewing the castles as the Duolingo A.I. lets me know it is time to review each of these skill sets, and then I'm using that prompt to update my notes here--as I didn't originally have this repo when I began doing this coursework.
