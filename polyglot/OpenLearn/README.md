  -  give examples of how language is related to culture in local, national and global contexts
  -  describe some traditions related to different cultures, using words from the relevant languages
  -  explain the importance of learning languages and being aware of cultural differences

## Intro: 
You don't need any prior knowledge to begin this study.


# 1 Careers in Languages:
## Section 1: Career Advice:

### Activity 1: Quotation
* ‘The best careers advice is: "Find out what you like doing best and get someone to pay you for doing it.”’
* Thinking Assignment: Write down what you think this quotation is trying to say. Make some notes on how you think this might apply to languages and language learning.
* Course Discussion: Most people would agree that being paid to do something you love is a good thing. However, you need to be thinking about whether this is good careers advice. Those who think that this is good careers advice would argue that being paid to do something you love means that your life and work won't be an obligation, but a joy. It would be better to have a good life than just earn lots of money. Others may disagree, believing that this is unrealistic. They may be of the opinion that we have to do things we don't like to be able to pay the bills. If you are always looking for someone to pay you for what you love, you'll end up unemployed too often. Others would think the statement is too vague. They may agree about finding something you love to do, but may disagree that it is the best career advice because it doesn't give any clear direction as to how you would go about achieving it.

### Activity 2: Variety of Possibilities
* Learning languages opens up many more career options than being a language teacher. Opportunities exist in translation and interpretation, in addition to careers abroad. A knowledge of languages is beneficial in many other sectors. Write down four careers that you think may involve the use of a foreign language.
* Discussion: Some possibilities you may have thought of:

    business services

    contact centres

    financial services

    media

    travel and tourism

    central government

    engineering

    marketing

    technology

    voluntary and charitable sector.

### Activity 3: Translation Misaps

    Have a look at the notices below and see if you can work out what each one is trying to say. As a native speaker, you may find them amusing because of the incorrect grammar.

    ‘It is forbitten to steal hotel towels please. If you are not person to do such thing is please not to read notis.’

    ‘Please to bathe inside the tub.’

    ‘To move the cabin, push button for wishing floor. If the cabin should enter more persons, each one should press a number of wishing floor. Driving is then going alphabetically in national order.’

    ‘For your convenience, we recommend courteous, efficient self-service.’

    ‘It is forbidden to enter a woman even a foreigner if dressed as a man.’

    ‘Specialist in women and other diseases.’

    ‘Order your summers suit. Because is big rush we will execute customers in strict rotation.’

    ‘Ladies may have a fit upstairs.’

    ‘It is strictly forbidden on our black forest camping site that people of different sex, for instance, men and women, live together in one tent unless they are married with each other for that purpose.’

    ‘Teeth extracted by the latest Methodists.’

    ‘Stop: Drive Sideways’
    
Discussion

In doing this activity, you will have seen that even though you may be laughed at, and even with bad grammar, you will generally be understood in context.

### Activty 4: English Nuances
* How would you explain the following phrases to someone who is not British, but does speak English?

    ‘Taking the mick’

    ‘Cheeky’
* Discussion There are many different ways of explaining these phrases. You may have explained that ‘taking the mick’ means to tease or mock someone. You may have described ‘cheeky’ in terms of a person who is rude or disrespectful, or someone who is just being a bit playful.

### Activity 5: Lost in Translation
There are many online translators and dictionaries available to help you to translate words and phrases from one language to another. However, many companies still need fluent speakers to help convey the intended meaning. This is particularly important in the context of cultural understanding behind phrases or idioms that may seem a bit odd.

Have a look at the poem extract below, which has been literally translated from the Persian language. Try to think of reasons why the translation may not work.

‘If that Turk from Shiraz

were to capture my heart

I would give away Samarkand and Bokhara

for her Hindu mole.’

Discussion

These lines come from a much longer poem, written by a 14th century poet. In its original language, Persian, it comes across as very exotic, lyrical, musical and evocative. We may look at the lines from a Western perspective and try to understand it in terms of our own culture and experience. As we have seen in the previous activity, knowledge of a culture can help you to understand the hidden meanings of certain phrases. We may not have understood the significance of the image of the Turk, or the relevance of the place names. Again, in the Persian, a mole may be considered a thing of beauty, which may not be the case in Western cultures.

This is an alternative translation, which attempts to convey the sentiment and meaning of the poem a bit more accurately, using Western place names and terms.

‘It that American in Venice

Were to coo "I love you too …"

I would barter Babylon and Rome

for her Japanese tattoo.‘

### Activity 6: Create Career Connections 
From what you have learnt so far in this course, try to write down three ways in which speaking more than one language could benefit your career.

Discussion

    People are most comfortable communicating in their native tongue.

    Even if you think ‘the whole world is learning English’, most would prefer to do business in their first language.

    If you speak the same language, you have a connection on which to base your professional relationship.

    You are more likely to understand your customers if you can communicate in both languages.
    
## 1.2 Be a Knight in Shining Armour
In your own country or abroad, being bilingual puts you in the position to be an ad-hoc translator. Even people who speak English are often not saying what they mean to say because of translation errors. It's generally fun to be able to help others. Not only does someone else benefit, but most speakers appreciate that their linguistic knowledge is being put to good use.

## 1.3 Function Among Locals 
There are often situations where not being able to speak a language can hold some people back from taking a job transfer abroad. If you have language skills, you will be a lot more confident about day-to-day tasks, if you are living abroad. Even if your job does only require you to know English, you will adjust a lot easier if you do know the local language. It can help with shopping, buying a house, or sending your children to school. It can also help you to make friends.

### Activity 7 Where do you want to go?
* Think about your own career or careers that you are considering for the future. Do any of these involve languages? Write your thoughts down and include as many details as you can about your aspirations for the future. Then think about how languages can help you get there. Regardless of the profession you've chosen, try to think of ways in which knowledge of languages may be able to help.
* This activity will have helped you to think about your career objectives, and to realise how versatile language skills can be.

## 1.4 Sample Professions 
Listed below is a small selection of possible careers in which languages could come into play. Have a think about whether these would be areas you would enjoy working in.

    Localiser: Someone who takes a product, like software, and adapts it to a specific locale, target market or language group.

    Voice-over: The language professional's voice adds a re-voicing that is a type of narration, commentary or dialogue.

    Assistant Volunteer Coordinator: This person would report to the volunteer coordinator, responsible for further developing, managing and evaluating the volunteer program, both domestic and international.
    
### Activity 8 Case Studies
Have a look at the case studies below. These present professions that you may be interested in yourself. In both cases, the professionals didn't know what they wanted to do while they were still in education. They had an interest in languages, which they pursued. Then, once they acquired the skills, they did a bit of travelling, taught English and figured out what they actually wanted to do with the skills and knowledge that they had acquired.
