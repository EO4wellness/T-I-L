* 2020-12-21: [lesson](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/polyglot/aleman/study-sessions/2020-12-21.md), looked up [special character set](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/polyglot/aleman/special-characters.md) for Typing German.  It doesn't work well on a laptop.  Apparently for ASCII to work best, you need a 10-key pad on your key board. Makes sense.  For now, I created a [CUT-n-PASTE German studies template](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/polyglot/aleman/special-characters.md) with these special German characters on it.
