# Log of Studies: 
* This log is a chronical (historical outline) of my studies and learning progress in learning and practicing the use of: MD and the German language. 
* In 2020, I started this log to practice markdown, git and github skills, as well as keeping a Today-I-Learned log of my activities. I'm keeping the 2021 log in "blog" order (reverse) so that the most recent activity is always at the top. 
* I primarily use two resources (currently) to study and learn German: Duolingo and Mondly.  
* I have an ongoing (more than a year) history of doing daily German language studies with Duolingo, having started in 2019. 
* I have a less than one month on-going history of doing language studies at Mondly.  With Mondly, I especially enjoy the native speakers and practice sounding like, and listening to, the native speech. 
* My Duolingo goal is to re-completed the Castle 1 lessons and quiz, since the course change in late 2020 moved my Castle 1 completion across several castles.
