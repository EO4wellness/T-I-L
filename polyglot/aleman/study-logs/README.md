# HISTORY:
* I began working, first on Duolingo and subsequently on Mondly, on learning the German language in October, 2019 and December, 2020 respectively.  
* My Duolingo German studies were "put on hold" during the fall and spring of 2019 and 2020 due to the Bertlesmann AI Tech Scholarship work. 
* I've now resumed regaruly German studies.  
* I most enjoy the voice(s) on Mondly and speak each lesson out-loud to practice listening and speaking skills. 
* Following in the #100DaysofCode style, I'm logging my most of my studies.
