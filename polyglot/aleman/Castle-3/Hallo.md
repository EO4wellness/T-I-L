# Hallo

## To be or… to be!
Let’s review German's to be verb!


ich bin
I am
	
wir sind
we are

du bist
you are
	
ihr seid
you all are

er / sie / es ist
he / she / it is
	
sie sind
they are


Notice that sie  is the word for she and they. 
They may look the same, but each one gets its own verb form!


## A plurality of plurals 
In English, we usually add ‑s to a word to make it plural, like cat and cats.
German has a couple different patterns for making plurals!

Single | Plural 
der Mann | die Männer
das Kind | die Kinder
die Frau | die Frauen
der Junge | die Jungen
das Mädchen | die Mädchen


Notice that when a noun is plural, the is always die!


##  And an umlaut on top!


Sometimes you’ll see two dots over a vowel, also known as an umlaut. 
The umlaut changes the sound of the vowel a bit!

Wasser, Mann
as in “father”

Mädchen, Männer
as in “bed”


__If you’re not sure how to type those umlaut characters, 
adding e after the vowel is also acceptable! 
For example, Maedchen or Maenner.__
