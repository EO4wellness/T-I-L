# Accusative

## We have a case to crack!
In English, we say He likes Sam, but Sam likes him. 
He changes to him because of the role it plays in the sentence. 
German does the same thing, but with lots of words, including ein  and der!


This change in form is known as case. 
The first case we’ll look at is called the accusative case! 

    basic form            |     accusative case
    
    der Apfel             |     Ich habe den Apfel.
    the apple                   I have the apple.
    
    ein Apfel             |     Ich esse einen Apfel.
    an apple                    I eat an apple.
    
    
Ask yourself, What do you have? or What do you like? 
Your answer will use the accusative case.


## Not everything changes!

In the accusative case, only masculine words change form, 
like der Apfel or der Junge. 
Feminine and neuter nouns stay the same!



masculine
	    der    → den
      ein    → einen
      
 
feminine
    die       → die
    eine      → eine
    
neuter
    das        → das
    ein        → ein
    
 
## Ich esse und du trinkst!

German verbs all change depending on if you’re talking about 
I, you, they and so on. But there’s a pattern in their endings! 


ich trinke
I drink
	
wir trinken
we drink

du trinkst
you drink
	
ihr trinkt
you all drink

er / sie / es trinkt
he / she / it drinks
	
sie trinken
they drink


Watch out for spelling changes in the main part of the verb, like lese and liest!
