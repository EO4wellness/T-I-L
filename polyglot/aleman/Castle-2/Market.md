Market
At the market
Outdoor markets are very popular in Germany! Local farmers sell their fruits, vegetables, cheeses, and meats, but don’t expect to find things that aren’t food, like clothes and jewelry. 
One Euro, two Euro
In English, say one Euro, two Euros. Not in German! It’s always just Euro
. 
Die Milch kostet zwei Euro
The milk costs two Euros
Lose the pound!
In Germany, people use the Kilo
 to measure weight. One pound is about half a kilogram!
Drei Kilo, bitte!
Three kilograms, please!
Eins, zwei, drei, let’s go!
How many days are in a week? How many people are in your family? How many apples are in your kitchen?
