## How’s the weather?
Not that exciting! 
Germany has a pretty mild climate.
If you want a hot getaway, you can join the Germans vacationing in Greece or Mallorca. 

## Wie ist das Wetter?
Like in English, use _es_  to talk about the weather!

    Wie ist das Wetter? | How is the weather?
    Es ist warm.        | It is warm.
    
## No matter the weather ...
... verbs
 in a statement stay in second position. 
 But words about when something happens can go at the beginning, the end, or right after the verb!
 
    Heute ist es warm.    |   It is warm today.
    Es ist heute kalt.    |   It is cold today.
    Es ist sonnig heute.  |   It is sunny today.
    
## How’s that?
In German, the word _wie_
 is used in some questions where we translate it as what in English!
 
    Wie ist das Wetter?  |   How is the weather? 
    Wie heißen Sie?      |  What is your name?
