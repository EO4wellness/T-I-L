## Who else speaks German?
Besides Duo, you, and people in Germany, who else speaks German? You can find many German speakers in Austria and Switzerland. There are also pockets of German speakers in Africa, South America, and the United States. 

## Are you? You are!
Have you ever played Twenty Questions?  Well, to ask yes or no questions in German, just switch the position of the subject
 and the verb. 
* Kanada ist groß. Canada is big.
* Ist Kanada groß? Is Canada big?

## How will this end?
In German, verb endings change depending on if you’re talking about ich, du, and so on.
* Ich komme aus Amerika. I come from America.
* Du kommst aus Deutschland. You come from Germany.

For most verbs, you add an ‑e for ich, and ‑st for du. You’ll learn other endings as we go along!
