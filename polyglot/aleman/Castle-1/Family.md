## Meine Familie!
German families are generally small—typically, parents will have one or two children. Parents might be married or unmarried, and same‑sex couples are very common. 


## Meine Mutter!
German nouns have gender! Some nouns are masculine, like Vater and Bruder, while others are feminine, like Mutter and Schwester. 
* eine Mutter und ein Vater
* a mother and a father

Notice that ein changes form! Words like ein or mein have different endings depending on the gender of the noun they’re paired with.
* mein Bruder und meine Schwester
* my brother and my sister


## I think, therefore...
In English, we say I am but you are. In German, you do the same thing!
* Ich bin Karl.
* I am Karl.
* Du bist sehr groß.
* You are very tall.
* Meine Schwester ist klug.
* My sister is smart.
