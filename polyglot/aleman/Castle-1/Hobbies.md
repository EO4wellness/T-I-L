# Hobbies

## Green thumbs
In Germany, people really like to garden. Ever heard of a Schrebergarten? Itâ€™s a small plot of land outside the city that people can purchase and tend as their garden. 

## Different strokes for different folks
### Verbs
 have different endings depending on the subject
 of the sentence. Lucky for you, er and sie use the same ending!
  
        subject   |   verb (schwimmen)
        ich       |   schwimme
        du        |   schwimmst
        er/sie    |   schwimmt
        
## Second is the best
In German statements, the verb is in the second place, or the second chunk. As you continue learning, other parts might move around while the important second place stays put!

* Ich male sehr gern. | I really like to paint.
* Mein Bruder spielt immer Schach. | My brother always plays chess.
