# Restaurant

## Mineralwasser, anyone?
Did you know that the most popular drink in Germany is sparkling water? It’s more popular than beer! Many restaurants don’t offer free tap water, so you’ll have to order a glass of sparkling water too.

## All of the genders!
There’s no reason why _der Salat_ is masculine and _die Pizza_ is feminine. That’s just how it is!

But wait, there’s a third gender: neuter! Neuter nouns go with _das_ and _ein_.
* das Sandwich, ein Sandwich | the sandwich, a sandwich

## Did you, uh, know this?
Did you notice that ‑er at the end of a word is pronounced like uh? Give it a try!

* Wasser (as in “uh”)
* Schwester (as in “uh”)
