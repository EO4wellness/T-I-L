# Greetings

## Guten Tag, Mr. Manager!
When you are in a formal setting like an office, you’ll want to say _guten Tag_  and _auf Wiedersehen_. It’s more polite than _hallo_  and _bis bald_.

## Shh! Listen up!
Lots of German words have a silent _h_. This silent _h_ makes the vowel before it just a little bit longer.

* es g_eh_t, auf Wieders_eh_en (as in “day”)
* S_oh_n (as in “zone”)
