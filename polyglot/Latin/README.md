# Latin 
* Course link: https://www.duolingo.com/learn 
* This course is unique because, of course, it is of a "dead language" as it is known. 
* However, as Latin was spoken for such a LONG time, historically speaking, and by such a large group of scholarly people groups, it still has value to study.
* Latin is especially useful in learning history and reading source documents.
* the Latin language, in effect, spilled into other cultures. 
* It is FUN to learn 
* This course is also unique because it is entirely spoken, for the sound files, by real people who are not native Latin speakers. 
* The fluency of the speakers gives you the sense, if they did it, I can too! 
* Duo course quirks:
    There are Latin Duolingo Events in the Duo calendar 
    There is a Latin-English Translation Dictionary 
    There is a Duo interface to see the words you've learned and how often you've practice them. 
    (as of Jan 26-2021 i've learned 50 words in Latin)
    There aren't any "Stories" be unlocked in this Latin course on Duo 
    There are only 3 Castles to the entire course 
* Prior to 1/26/2021, this Latin course was within the "OTHER" languages studied section on GitHub.  
* As of Jan 26, 2021, I've moved it to its own folder, not included within the "other" languages portion of the Polyglot repo. 
* These thoughts are my own, based on my studies at University.  If the topic interests you, and you are reading this, why not check out [Wiki's Latin article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for a very basic overview.
