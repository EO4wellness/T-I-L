Adjectives

Just like nouns, adjectives follow declensions. The adjective solus (masc.), sola (fem.), solum (neut.) follow the first and second declension, and get the same endings as nouns: discipulus - femina - Eboracum.

Have a look at how the ending of the adjective changes:
Latin 	English 	Gender
discipulus novus 	a new student 	masculine
familia nova 	a new family 	feminine
civitas nova 	a new state 	feminine
Novum Eboracum 	New York 	neuter
nomen novum 	a new name 	neuter

When using sum, you also need to make sure the adjective agrees with the noun.
Latin 	English
Marcus est Romanus. 	Marcus is Roman.
Livia Americana est. 	Livia is American.
Nomen est novum. 	The name is new.
Ego solus sum. 	I am alone. (masculine)
Ego sola sum. 	I am alone. (feminine)
Locative

The locative case is a special case which indicates a location used for cities.

Some general rules:

    -a (first declension) becomes -ae
    -us and -um (second declension) become -i

Nominative 	Locative 	English (loc.)
Roma 	Romae 	in Rome
Novum Eboracum 	Novi Eboraci 	in New York
Corinthus 	Corinthi 	in Corinth

Other locations will generally get a preposition (in + ablative, we will deal with the ablative later in the course).
Latin 	English
in Italia 	in Italy
in urbe 	in the city

Domi (at home) is an exception!
Num

The particle num indicates that the speaker expects a negative answer; the speaker would be surprised if someone answered yes.

Compare the following sentences.
Latin 	English 	Expected Answer
Num Romae habitat? 	Surely he doesn't live in Rome? 	Negative
Habitatne Romae? 	Does he live in Rome? 	- (neutral)
-tas

The suffix -(i)tas is the equivalent of the English -(i)ty. These nouns follow the third declension and are feminine.
Latin 	English
universitas 	university
libertas 	liberty, freedom
difficultas 	difficulty, trouble
