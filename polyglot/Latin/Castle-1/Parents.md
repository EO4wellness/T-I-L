Third Declension (Nouns)

It is time to properly introduce the third declension! You already know quite a few words that follow the third declension. Masculine and feminine nouns follow the same pattern, while neuter nouns are declined differently.
- 	PATER 	SOROR 	NOMEN
nom. sg. 	pater 	soror 	nomen
acc. sg. 	patrem 	sororem 	nomen (=)
nom. pl. 	patres 	sorores 	nomina
acc. pl. 	patres 	sorores 	nomina (=)

A rule of thumb: accusative neuter words are always the same as their nominative equivalent.
Third Declension (Adjectives)

Many adjectives of the third declension end in -is. These adjectives will get (-is, -is, -e) as additional information in the vocabulary lists.

    The paterfamilias was the head of a Roman household. This was usually the oldest man in the family. "Pater familias" literally means "father of the family".
