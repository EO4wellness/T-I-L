* 2020-12-20 first day of study for a few weeks. I don't regularly study Italian so I don't have a "streak" for the number of days I've studied it. I believe this is day 3 or 4 of ever studying it.  Successfully "reviewed" castle 1, Basic skills 1. Discovered to open "stories" I would need to earn 10 crowns first. I currently have earned 8. <br>
* 2020-12-20 successfully completed round 2 of "Intro 1" on Castle 1 today. Advanced to round 3. <br>
* 2020-12-24 Reviewed Basics 1 and did a new lesson in [Basics 2, earning my next level of study](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/polyglot/italiano/castle-1/Basics-2.md#2020-12-24).<br>
