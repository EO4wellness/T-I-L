2020-12-20 first day of study for a few weeks. I don't regularly study Italian so I don't have a "streak" for the number of days I've studied it. I believe this is day 3 or 4 of ever studying it.  Successfully "reviewed" castle 1, Basic skills 1. Discovered to open "stories" I would need to earn 10 crowns first. I currently have earned 8. <br>
