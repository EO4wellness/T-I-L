# Food
*i unlocked the food skill set on december 30th, 2020; but i didn't start working on this skill set until i finished the one before it. 

## Ingredients
* Italian has three ways to express the presence of an ingredient in the name of a dish:

    1. Dish di ingredient: the ingredient is the main or only component of the dish
    e.g. "succo di limone" (lemon juice). 
    In this case the article is never used before the ingredient.
    
    2. Dish con ingredient: the ingredient is a visible component of the dish or used as garnish
    e.g. "fragole con panna" (strawberries with cream). 
    In this case a definite article can be used before the ingredient.
    
    3. Dish a ingredient: the dish has been flavored with the ingredient, or tastes like the ingredient
    e.g. "gelato al cioccolato" (chocolate ice cream)
    In this case the definite article is mandatory before the ingredient, forming an articulated preposition with a.

* When there is no room for confusion the three can occasionally be mixed up, e.g. "panino al salame" is as common as "panino con salame"; however, in many cases using one instead of the other can give hints on the dish's composition.


## Questions
In this section you'll meet the first proper questions. 
In Italian word order doesn't change in a question, meaning that the question mark at the end 
and the raising tone of voice are usually the only differences between a question and a statement.


## Pointer 
It's important to keep in mind that the English idiom of "having food" 
being synonymous with "eating food" doesn't apply to Italian,
where "avere cibo" simply means owning food.
