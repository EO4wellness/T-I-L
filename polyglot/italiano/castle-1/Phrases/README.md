# Negations

* In this section you'll use negations for the first time.

* The English no has two main uses:

      Particle (e.g. "no!"): this translates directly to the Italian no.
      Determiner (e.g. "no one"): you'll learn the translations for this in a later section.

* The English not almost always translates to the Italian non. However, while not often follows the verb it negates or its auxiliary, the Italian non always precedes it.

# Greetings

    Ciao is used both ways in Italian: when meeting (also salve) and when parting (also arrivederci or addio).
    Buongiorno and buonasera are normally used when meeting, although they can be used when parting as well: the first is used in the first half of the day and the latter in the remaining half.
    Buonanotte is always used when parting, as it presumes that the day is over (same as "good night").
    Prego is a courtesy form used in many occasions to accompany a kind action, and it's the customary answer to reply to received thanks.
    Per favore, per piacere and per cortesia are courtesy forms used when asking for something.
