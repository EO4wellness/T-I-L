# INTRO:
Italian is so much like Spanish, I find it fun to do a lesson once in a while--perhaps one a week, or once a month.  So far I've completed one skill set. 

# CASTLES: 
In Duolingo, Castles represent a skill set and pathway to learning.  This is conducted very much so like a highschool or college/university course with a mixture of listening, speaking, transcribing skills regularly taught and practiced daily. 
<br>
* [Castle 1](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/tree/main/polyglot/italiano/castle-1) - This is one I'm currently working on--though not too seriously. 
* [Castle 2](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/tree/main/polyglot/italiano/castle-2/README.md)
* . . . more . . . 

# TRAVEL: 
Many "moons" ago, I had occasion to travel to Italy.  I found while in Italy, my (then more) limited knowledge of Spanish allowed me to conduct negotiations with the shopkeeps and to navigate most public signs/transportion/menu items, despite knowing Italian what-so-ever.  While I was there, I enjoyed the country, experience, culture, and people. While all of Italy is A M A Z I N G and beautiful, I especially enjoyed visiting the Isle of Capri and the [Blue Grotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grotto_(Capri)), which frankly photos don't do it justice.  <br>
