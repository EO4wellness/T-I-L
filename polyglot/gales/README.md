More than a year ago, I started learning the Welsh language on the Duolingo learning platform.  I liked it so much, I've studied Welsh more than a year now. It is FUN to learn! It is fun to speak! It is NOT fun to spell! This Repo, in the style of [#100-days-of-code or anything-in this case Welsh](https://github.com/EO4wellness/100-days-of-code), is a record of my Welsh-learning chronicals.  Day by day, brief lesson notes or study log chronicalling my progress learning Welsh. <br>

# Study Topics: 
* There are lots of GREAT study topics in the Welsh course.  
* While ALL of the languages, have great "discussion" or forum content on Duolingo, the Welsh topic is extremely helpful! 
* It seems the other Welsh students are VERY up-to-date and knowledgeable.
