Wanting

Remember - please do not report audio faults or mispronunciations, as there is nothing that the course team can do about them at present.
'I am' and 'You are'

Very simply:

    dw i means 'I am', and
    dych chi means 'you are'

Wanting

There are several ways to express want in Cymraeg, and in this unit the noun eisiau is used. For example:

    dw i eisiau... - 'I am' + 'want' = 'I want....'
    dych chi eisiau... - 'you are' + 'want' = 'you want....'

You can follow eisiau with another noun or a verb-noun. For example:

    Dw i eisiau siocled. - I want (some/a) chocolate.
    Dych chi eisiau mynd. - You want to go.

Note - For those who have done a little Welsh before, remember that the noun eisiau does not have 'n/yn in front of it. The pattern is an exceptional one in Welsh.

Note that Welsh makes no distinction between 'a chocolate', 'some chocolate' or 'chocolate' - there is no specific word for 'a' or 'some' in this sense:

    Dw i eisiau coffi. - I want a coffee. = I want some coffee. = I want coffee.

Note that in a negative sentence coffi may also mean '...any coffee':

    Dw i ddim eisiau coffi. - I do not want coffee. = I do not want a coffee. = I do not want any coffee.

Note that eisiau is often pronounced isio, isie or isia (although the course voice does not reflect this) and in informal writing it is sometimes spelt as it is pronounced. On the course, we use the standard spelling eisiau, although isio is also introduced as it the version taught in the 'north' versions of the introductory DysguCymraeg courses for adults in Wales.
And

The word for 'and' is a, or ac before vowels:

    afal a lemon - an apple and a lemon
    afal ac oren - an apple and an orange

The vowels in Welsh are a, e, i, o, u - as in English, and also w and y.
Asking the question

With dych chi (you are), we simply put a question mark at the end of the sentence and use a rising intonation at the end of the question, as in English - Dych chi...?:

    Dych chi eisiau car newydd? - Do you want a new car?

Note that it is not always this simple - some verbs use modified forms for the question. These will be introduced later in the course.
Saying "yes", "no", and "thank you"

This skill also introduces one of the several ways of saying "yes" and "no" in Welsh. The ways of answering 'yes' or 'no' in Welsh are quite varied . For example, in this unit we will practice:

    Ydw - Yes (I am/I do)
    Nac ydw - No (I'm not/I don't)

(Note that the Ydw in these a verb related to Dw i (i am). In very many forms of Welsh 'Yes/No' responses we are using a form of a verb instead of words specifically for 'yes' or 'no'. There are specific yes/no words, but they are only used in particular circumstances. This is not a straightforward thing to learn as a beginner, so the various yes/no responses are introduced gradually as they come up in the course for the first time. They are always explained with examples in the relevant course notes, though.)

Note that if you do use the isio dialect form of eisiau, the answer yes/no is different - Oes (Yes); Nac oes (No) - no matter who is answering:

    Dach chi/Wyt ti isio coffi? Oes/Nac oes.

Perhaps you might want some ice cream (hufen iâ), and since you are polite, you will want to say 'thank you ' if someone offers it - diolch (thank you):

    Dych chi eisiau hufen iâ? Ydw. Diolch - "Do you want an ice cream? Yes. Thank you.
    Dych chi eisiau hufen iâ? - Nac ydw, ond diolch. - Do you want an ice cream? No, but thank you.
    Ydw, dw i eisiau hufen iâ. Diolch. - Yes, I do want some ice cream. Thanks.
    Nac ydw, dw i ddim eisiau hufen iâ, diolch. - No, I don't want any ice cream, thanks.

For a simple 'No thanks' we have a different expression - Dim diolch:

    Dych chi eisiau hufen iâ? Dim diolch. - Do you want an ice-cream? No thanks.

Welsh - Cymraeg

The word for 'Welsh', meaning 'the Welsh language' is Cymraeg:

    Dw i eisiau dysgu Cymraeg. - I want to learn Welsh.

There are other meanings and uses of Cymraeg which are introduced later in the course.
Pronunciation - keep practising!

Now would be a good time to go back over those pronunciation videos that we recommended earlier in the course: here they are again https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16sqX2Baprg&list=
