Present Tense 3

In this unit, other forms of the present tense of bod (to be) are introduced.
'You' - Ti and Chi

As in several other European lanaguages, Welsh has two forms of 'you', ti and chi, and different forms of verbs are used with each:

Ti is only used with an individual, never with more than one person:

    When talking to an individual with whom you are on familiar terms, such as a friend, relative or close colleague.
    When talking to a child.
    When talking or praying to a deity.

Chi is used:

    When addressing more than one person, familiar or not.
    When talking with someone you don't know.
    With an individual in formal settings.

The forms of bod (to be)

The pronouns we use are:

    i - I
    ti - you (singular familiar)
    e, o - he (sometimes fe/fo)
    hi - she
    ni - we
    chi - you (plural, and formal singular)
    nhw - they

Note that for 'he', e is generally used in dialects in west, south and some of mid-Wales, o in north and other parts of mid-Wales.

Here is the pattern of the present tense of bod:
Positive 	Question 	Negative 	Translation
[ry)dw i 	(y)dw i? 	(dy)dw i ddim 	I am, am I?, I am not
rwyt ti 	wyt ti? 	dwyt ti ddim 	you (sing.) are..., etc.
mae e/o 	ydy e/o? 	dydy/dyw e/o ddim 	he is... etc.
mae hi 	ydy hi? 	dydy/dyw hi ddim 	she is... etc.
(ry)dyn ni 	(y)dyn ni? 	(dy)dyn ni ddim 	we are... etc.
(ry)dych chi 	(y)dych chi? 	(dy)dych chi ddim 	you (pl) are... etc.
maen nhw 	(y)dyn nhw? 	(dy)dyn nhw ddim 	they are... etc

(ry)dw i shows the fuller form in brackets (rydw) compared to the basic spoken form taught on this course (dw i). The fuller forms are sometimes taught in schools, and are used in the media, too.

Note in dialects in south, west and parts of mid-Wales the pronoun 'he' is usually e, while in north Wales and other parts of mid-Wales 'he' is usually o.

Note that on introductory courses using DysguCymraeg 'north' materials, you will be taught dan ni, dach chi, dan nhw, etc. This reflects local pronunciation.

Note that mae is also used with nouns, both plural and singular:

    Mae'r plant yn chwarae. - The children are playing.
    Mae Siôn a Siân yn licio cerdded. - Siôn and Siân like walking.
    Mae'r car a'r beic yn las. - The car and the bike are blue.

Note that with verbs the third person plural form is only used with the pronoun nhw.

Note that Yw... is not used to start a question, only Ydy...? is used.

Note that the third person singular negatives dyw and dydy have the same meaning and are interchangeable.

Remember, to form the present tense we use the appropriate part of the verb to be (bod) + 'n/yn and the required verb. For example:

    Dw i'n canu. - I am singing.
    Wyt ti'n canu? - Are you singing?
    Dyw e ddim yn canu. - He is not singing.

Courses in parts of north and mid-Wales may teach the forms dan ni and dach chi, etc, following local pronunciation. Those forms are accepted on this Duolingo course.
Emphatic sentences

In earleir section we saw that when identifying someone by theri job or name, we put that fist in the sentence:

    Sam dw i. - I'm Sam.
    Athro dych chi? - Are you a teacher?

In identifying sentences in the third person we use ydy/yw following the identifier, or with a plural, ydyn:

    John yw e. - He's John.
    Mecanic yw hi. - She is a mechanic.
    Athrawes ydy hi? - Is she a teacher?
    Ffermwyr ydyn nhw? - Are they farmers?

More on Yes and No

We have already met the responses Ydw - 'Yes (I am) and Nac ydw - 'No (I am not).

To form the 'Yes' and 'No' in other persons, take the question form and remove the pronoun:

    Ydy hi'n canu? - Is she singing? - Ydy - Yes (she is); Nac ydy - No (she is not)
    Dych chi'n cerdded, Megan a Siôn? - Ydyn - Yes (We are); Nac ydyn - No (we are not)
    Ydyn nhw'n bwyta? - Ydyn - Yes (they are); Nac ydyn - No (they are not)

If the question starts with something other than the verb we use a much simpler yes/no system - Ie/Nage. For example:

    Athrawes dych chi? Ie. - Are you a teacher? Yes.
    John yw e? Nage, Sam.. - Is he John? No, Sam.
    Athro ydy Siôn? Nage, trydanwr ydy e. - Is Siôn a teacher? No, he's an electrician.
