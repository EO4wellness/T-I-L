# Coursework Notes:
This unit teaches the present perfect tense, yr amser perffaith, using wedi.

# Present Perfect Tense
This tense is used to describe something, saying that the activity has been completed - that is why the activity is 'perfect'!

This tense can be seen in English with 'have/has', and often, although not always, followed with the '-ed' verb-ending. For example:
      
       I have swum 300 metres.
       We have enjoyed lunch, thank you.
       Siôn has eaten well this evening.
       She has played well today.
       They have enjoyed themselves.
       She has paid the bill already.
        
Note: this tense is not the same as the simple past tense 'I swam', I enjoyed', 'I ate', 'I finished' - that is a different tense, the simple past, in both English and Welsh, and it is covered in later sections of the course.


# Present Tense 
In the Welsh present tense we use forms of bod with yn/'n

    Dw i'n mynd - I am going
    Maen nhw'n bwyta pasta - They are eating pasta.

There, yn/'n shows that the action is unfinished - it is still incomplete.

In Welsh, the present perfect tense pattern uses the same present tense forms of bod and we simply use wedi instead of yn/'n, to show that that action has been completed - 'I have gone.', 'They have eaten..,'

    Dw i wedi nofio 300 metr. - I have swum 300 metres. (But not 'I swam...' - that is a different tense, the simple past).)
    Dyn ni wedi mwynhau cinio. - We have enjoyed lunch. (But not 'We enjoyed...')
    Mae Siôn wedi bwyta'n dda heno. - Siôn has eaten well this evening. (But not 'Siôn ate...')

Note that yn/'n is never used at the same time as wedi - the action cannot be incomplete and complete at the same time. For example, * Dw i'n wedi mynd would make no sense.

More examples:

    Dw i wedi gorffen. - I have finished.
    Mae'r plant wedi codi. - The children have got up.
    Mae Sioned wedi yfed coffi. - Sioned has drunk a coffee.
    Dyn ni wedi chwarae pêl-droed. - We have played football.
    Dw i wedi mynd i siopa. - I have gone shopping.
    Mae e wedi darllen y nofel. - He has read the novel.

# Questions 
Questions can be asked and answered in the same way as with the present tense:

    Wyt ti wedi cael cinio? Ydw - Have you had lunch? Yes.
    Ydy hi wedi mynd? Ydy. Has she gone? Yes.
    Ydyn nhw wedi bod yno eto? Nac ydyn - Have they been there yet? No.

In parts of north Wales, and as taught in the 'north' versions of the intoductory and intermediate DysguCymraeg courses, Do/Naddo can be used in answers to questions in the present perfect tense with wedi:

    Dan ni wedi bod yma o'r blaen? Do/Naddo. - Have we been here before? Yes/No.
    Dach chi wedi gorffen y gwaith? Do/Naddo. - Have you finished the work? Yes/No.
    Ydy o wedi dŵad i weld Siân? Do/Naddo. - has he come to see Siân? Yes/No.


# Negatives 
Negatives

Negatives also work in the same way as with the present tense:

    Dw i ddim wedi bod i Sbaen eto. - I have not been to Spain yet.
    Dydyn nhw ddim wedi bod yn yr Almaen o'r blaen. - They have not been in Germany before.
    Dydy'r plant ddim wedi bwyta wyau heddiw - the children haven't eaten any eggs today.


# Washing versus Getting Washed
* Golchi vs ymolchi 
* ym- is quite a common verb prefix in Welsh. It often indicates a reflexive action - something that someone does to themselves. This is not always obvious in the English translation. In golchi (washing) and ymolchi (washing oneself, getting washed) it is very clear, though

    Mae hi wedi golchi'r car. - She has washed the car.
    Mae hi wedi ymolchi. - She has got washed; She has washed herself; She has had a wash.
