# Days of the week
* On its own, the word dydd means 'day'. 
* In combination with other words it is used in the names of the days of the week.
* Most of the days of week are named after planets in Welsh
* some are also very similar to the days of the week in Latin and the Romance languages.
* Note - include dydd in the name of the day. 

        Sunday - dydd Sul - (Sul is an old word for the Sun, no longer used for that)
        Monday - dydd Llun - (Llun is an old word for the Moon, no longer used for that).
        Tuesday - dydd Mawrth - (Mawrth - the planet Mars)
        Wednesday - dydd Mercher - (Mercher- the planet Mercury)
        Thursday - dydd Iau - (Iau - Jupiter. Note that Iau starts with a capital 'i', not a lower case L)
        Friday - dydd Gwener - (Gwener - Venus)
        Saturday - dydd Sadwrn - (Sadwrn - Saturn)


## Morning and afternoon
### Terms:

    bore = morning
    prynhawn = afternoon

### To say 'Monday morning', Tuesday afternoon' and so on we just put the name of the day after the word for the time of day:

    bore dydd Llun = Monday morning, (but this is sometimes cut down to just bore Llun).

### Similarly,

    Tuesday afternoon = prynhawn dydd Mawrth (but this is sometimes cut down to just prynhawn Mawrth).

### All the names of the days of the week can be combined in this way for morning or afternoon.

## Night and evening

Nos can be combined with the names of the days of the week to mean 'Sunday night' and so on. It is also used in this way for the names of evenings:

    nos Sadwrn - Saturday night or Saturday evening
    nos Sul - Sunday night/evening
    nos Iau - Thursday night/evening

Some names of days undergo a slight change (a soft mutation) when used with nos. The reason for this is explained later in the course, so just learn these for now:

    nos Lun - Monday night/evening
    nos Fawrth - Tuesday night/evening
    nos Fercher - Wednesday night/evening
    nos Wener - Friday night/evening

Note that we do not use dydd with nos - * nos dydd Sul would be incorrect..
For the days of the week, always combine the name with some other element

Note that there should always be something in front of the name of the day - dydd..., bore dydd..., bore..., prynhawn dydd..., nos..., etc - do not use just the name of the day on its own, or it could be mistaken for the name of one of the planets.

Note that dydd, bore, prynhawn, nos do not usually take a capital letter in the names of days unless at the beginning of a sentence or as part of a special day (for example, Dydd Calan - New Year's Day).
'On' a particular day

To say that we are doing something 'on' Thursday, say, we do not use a separate word for 'on', we simply change the word dydd to ddydd:

    Dw i'n gweithio ddydd Gwener. - I am working on Friday.

This change does not apply if we use bore or prynhawn:

    Dw i'n gweithio prynhawn dydd Sul. - I am working on Sunday afternoon.
    Dw i'n gweithio bore dydd Iau. - I am working on Thursday morning.

Note that this form is not used for habitual timings such as saying 'I work on a Friday', 'I work on Fridays' or 'Do you watch televison on Sunday?' - for that we use the preposition ar:

    Dw i'n gweithio ar ddydd Gwener. - I work on Fridays; I work on a Friday; I work Friday.
    Dw i'n mynd i Aber ar nos Lun. - I go to Aber on Monday evenings/on a Monday evening.

Note - ar is also used for 'on' with dates and with named holidays such as Dydd Nadolig (Christmas Day), Nos Galan (New Year's Eve) and so on.
