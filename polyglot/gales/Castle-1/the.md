The 1
The definite article - 'the'

When saying the in Cymraeg, there are three forms used: 'r, yr and y.

To know which form to use, 'r, yr or y, just go through the sequence 1, 2, 3 below and use whichever one applies first. Note that the 'r, yr, y refers to the word following it in each case:

1 - 'r is used following, and attached to, a word ending in a vowel (a e i o u w y, in Welsh), regardless of what letter the next word starts with. For example:

    hoffi'r afal - liking the apple [...'r afal = ...the apple]
    casáu'r tywydd
    mynd i'r dre

2 - yr is used before vowels and h-. For example:

    maint yr afal
    blas yr oren
    yn ystod yr wythnos

3 - Otherwise, y is used. For example:

    gan y bachgen
    wrth y ferch

An example of all three:

    Dw i'n hoffi'r car, y beic, yr awyren a'r eliffant.

Note - occasionally, you will see 'y' instead of 'yr' used in front of some words beginning with w-. This is not necessarily wrong, so do not think that you have misunderstood the rules if you do come across it. It tends to occur with feminine nouns beginning with gw-, especially gwl-, gwn-, gwr-, where the -w- has the quality of a consonant. For example, y wawr, y wers, y wraig, y wlad, y wrach.

Note that 'r is always written attached to the preceding word - this is not always obvious in Duolingo as its underlying display formatting rules sometimes separates them. The course team have no control over that.
Weak soft mutation of feminine nouns after 'r/y (the)

'r/y cause a 'weak' soft mutation of feminine nouns. 'Weak' because the initial letters ll- and rh- resist the mutation caused by 'r/y. Here are examples of the weak soft mutation of some feminine nouns:

    pleidlais, y bleidlais - a vote, the vote
    tafarn, y dafarn - a pub, the pub
    cân, y gân - a song, the song
    bwydlen, y fwydlen - a menu, the menu
    desg, y ddesg - a desk, the desk
    gardd, yr ardd - a garden, the garden
    merch, y ferch - a girl, the girl
    llaw, y llaw - a hand, the hand (no mutation)
    rhaw, y rhaw - a spade, the spade (no mutation)

Plural nouns and masculine noun do not mutate after 'r/y.
The Welsh Alphabet - Yr Wyddor Gymraeg

In Cymraeg, the alphabet has 28 letters (29 if we include the loan letter j). Eight of the letters, called 'digraphs', are written as two characters - but in Cymraeg, these always count as a single letter.

In the list, v stands for vowel (llafariad), c for consonant (cytsain), and d for digraph (deugraff). All digraphs are also consonants. The name of the letter is in brackets (some have more than one) - the grave accent ` over e just indicates that is pronounced as a short vowel, and ˆ indicates a long vowel.

    A (â) - v
    B (bî) - c
    C (èc) - c
    Ch (èch) - d
    D (dî) - c
    Dd (èdd) - d
    E (ê) - v
    F (èf) - c
    Ff (èff) - d
    G (èg) - c
    Ng (èng) - d
    H (âets, hâ) - c
    I (î, î-dot) - v
    J (jê) - c
    L (èl) - c
    Ll (èll) - d
    M (èm)- c
    N (èn) - c
    O (ô) - v
    P (pî) - c
    Ph (ffî) - d
    R (êr) - c
    Rh (rhî, rhô) - d
    S (ès) - c
    T (tî) - c
    Th (èth) - d
    U (û, û-bedol, û-cwpan, û-utgorn) - v
    W (ŵ) - v
    Y (ŷ) - v

Note that in some regional accents, î and û can sound the same or very similar, so it can be useful to call them î-dot and û-bedol, etc to distinguish them clearly.

Note that many people use the sounds of the letters rather than the names of the letters when spelling things out - be careful to notice which method they are using!

Note that you must be careful to remember the digraphs when looking up words in a Welsh dictionary. For example, chwech comes after cywir because ch is a different letter from c and comes after it in a dictionary.
