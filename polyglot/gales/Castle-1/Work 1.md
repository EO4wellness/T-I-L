# Work Terms and Notes
## In this unit, we study some common nouns for work, as well as some common occupations. 

* Actor dw i.  (I am an actor)
* Actores dw i.  (I am an actress.)
* Ffermwr dw i. (I am a farmer)
* Siaradwr dw i.  (I am a speaker).

## In Wesh, the name of the occupation comes first in the sentence.  In Welsh this is the proper order--just like we've already learned about putting a proper noun / Name first.  
Example: 
* Dewi dw i.  Ffermwr dw i.  
* I am Dewi.  I am a farmer. 

# Asking Name or Profession
## Likewise, in Welsh, use the same pattern to aks what someone's name is, or what their job is. 
## As in english, use a rising tone at the end of such a sentence to indicate it is a question. 
##  If a question doesn't start with a verb, use "le (yes" or "Nage (no".



    Athro dych chi? - Are you a teacher?
    John dych chi? - Are you John?
    Nyrs dych chi? Ie. - Are you a nurse? Yes.
    Athro dych chi? Nage, actor dw i. - Are you a teacher? No, I'm an actor.

There is one exception--based on Welsh dialecs you may hear  "Naci" or other variations instead of "Nage" 

# Names of occupations

Many originally male-orientated occupations and nouns will end in -wr (from gŵr meaning 'a man'), such as ffermwr, and siaradwr, but these can be changed to a specifically female version of the same occupation by changing the -wr to -wraig (from gwraig meaning 'a woman'). For example:

    Ffermwr (a farmer) => Ffermwraig (specifically a female farmer)
    Siaradwr (a speaker) => Siaradwraig (specifically a female speaker)
    Dysgwr (a learner) => Dysgwraig (specifically a female learner)

In practice, though, the female versions are not always used. The base version is also used as the non-gendered word, even though it remains a grammatically male noun.

A few other occupations have their own specifically feminine versions, such as:

    athro; athrawes (a teacher).
    ysgrifennydd; ysgrifenyddes (a secretary)

Others make no distinction and can be used for either gender:

    mecanic - a mechanic
    cyfrifydd - an accountant
    heddwas - a police officer
    meddyg, doctor - a doctor
    nyrs - a nurse
    peiriannydd - an engineer

Working somewhere

To say where we work, we use mewn or yn, both meaning 'in' or sometimes 'at'

The difference between yn and mewn is that yn is in a specific place, whilst mewn means in a non-specific place. Yn is also used when saying 'in the...' (yn y...), in your..., in Cardiff, and so on. (Note that when yn is used fot 'in/at' it does not contract to 'n after a vowel):

    Dw i'n gweithio yn Abertawe - I work in Swansea.
    Dw i'n gweithio yn y theatr yn Abertawe - I work in the theatre in Swansea.
    Dw i'n gweithio mewn theatr yn Abertawe - I work in a theatre in Swansea.
    Dw i'n gweithio yn Tesco yn Abertawe - I work in Tesco in Swansea (a specific shop in a named place)
    Dw i'n gweithio mewn siop - I work in a shop.
    Dw i'n gweithio mewn ysgol - I work in a school.
    Dw i'n gweithio mewn ysgol Gymraeg yn Abertawe - I work in a Welsh-medium school in Swansea.

'Welsh', 'Wales', 'Welsh language', 'Welsh-language'

It is important to distinguish between the various meanings of 'Welsh' and related words:

    Cymraeg, y Gymraeg - A noun meaning 'Welsh', 'the Welsh language'.
    Cymraeg - an adjective meaning 'Welsh-language' (books, programmes, etc), 'Welsh-speaking' (person) or, in education in particular, 'Welsh-medium' (that is, through the medium of the Welsh language).
    Cymreig - an adjective meaning 'Welsh' as in belonging to to or pertaining to Wales (rather than to the language).

    Cymraes (Cymraësau) - a Welsh woman (Welsh women)
