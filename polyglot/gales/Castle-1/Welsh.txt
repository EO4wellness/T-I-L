# Numbers 
There are two counting systems in Cymraeg: the decimal and vigesimal systems. During this course, you will learn both.

In this section you will learn the modern decimal system (y system ddegol in Cymraeg) that is based on tens. This use of the system is wider than compared to the traditional vigesimal system, and is suitable in most situations. It is quite straightforward to learn.

The traditional vigesimal system (y system ugeiniol in Cymraeg) is based on twenties. It is still used when telling the time and when using ordinal numbers in a date (2nd, 20th, 31st, and so on). It is still often used when talking about money, and about someone's age. We cover this system later in the course.

More information on both systems can be found [here in this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_numerals).

# Some Numbers 
The modern system in Welsh follows a regular decimal pattern:

# Construction of Numbers 
Note that once you know the first ten numbers you can construct the rest very easily. For example: Pedwar deg chwech - Forty-six (literally 'four ten(s), six')

# Different forms of dau, tri, pedwar used with feminine nouns

Although it is not practised in this section, you may come across some other forms of 2, 3 and 4 which are always used with feminine nouns. Here, athro (teacher) is masculine and athrawes is specifically a female teacher:

    dau athro, dwy athrawes
    tri athro, tair athrawes
    pedwar athro, pedair athrawes

These forms will be practised later in the course.

Singular nouns follow numbers

Note that in Welsh the singular noun is used after a number, not the plural. For example:

    Dau oren - Two oranges (not * dau orenau)
    Un deg pum afal - fifteen apples (not * un deg pum afalau)
    Tri afal - Three apples (not * tri afalau)
    Pum deg tri oren - Fifty-three oranges (not * pum deg tri orenau)


Note that pump, chwech and cant (100) drop their last letter (-p, -ch, -t) in front of nouns, changing to pum, chwe and can.

## Language Learning Tip: 
When giving the Welsh answers in this section and elsewhere, please write out the number in full - this is important practice!

# Using dau and dwy after the definite article 'r/yr/y

Both dau and dwy change after the definite article:

    y ddau eliffant - the two elephants
    y ddwy arth - the two bears

Ths type of change is called a 'soft mutation', and it is covered in more detail later in the course.

# Hyphens in numbers in English

Normal English usage is to put a hyphen between two-part numbers - twenty-five, thirty-one, ninety-nine, etc. This avoids confusion between expressions such as 'thirty four-part complete kits' and 'thirty-four part-complete kits'.





#Clothing Terms 
Some of the words for clothing introduced in this unit are 
(f - feminine, m - masculine, pl - plural):

    siwmper f - a jumper, pullover, sweater
    het f - a hat
    ffrog f - a dress/frock
    cot, côt f - a coat
    coban f - a nightdress
    fest f - a vest
    cot law f - a raincoat
    crys m - a shirt
    gwregys m - a belt
    crys chwys m - a sweatshirt
    trowsus m - (a pair of) trousers/pants
    esgidiau pl - shoes
    menig pl - gloves
    sanau pl - socks
    jîns pl - jeans

# Articles in Welsh
There is no 'a/an' in Welsh

Remember that there is no indefinite article 'a/an' in Welsh:

    het - 'hat' or 'a hat'
    crys - 'shirt' or 'a shirt'

In the following sentences, for example, 'a/an' is required to make sense in the English, even though there is no equivalent in the Welsh:

    Dw i'n gwisgo cot law - I am wearing a raincoat
    Dw i eisiau sgarf - I want a scarf

Similarly, with plurals we may use the word 'some' in the English translation where there is no equivalent in the Welsh:

    Dw i eisiau jîns newydd - I want some new jeans
    Dw i'n gwisgo sanau - 'I'm wearing socks' or 'I'm wearing some socks'

# Ownership of Items 
To show that someone owns something we simply put the 'owner' after the thing 'owned':

    crys Tom - Tom's shirt
    esgidiau Sioned - Sioned's shoes

# ADJECTIVES 
Adjectives usually come after the noun

When we are describing things, the adjective, the describing word, usually comes after the noun in Welsh:

    cot law - a raincoat
    dillad ysgol - school clothes
    esgidiau rhedeg - running shoes
    jîns newydd - new jeans
