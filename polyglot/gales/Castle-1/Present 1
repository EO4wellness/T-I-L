# Introduction:
* Previously, before beginning the log of my studies in this repository for the #100DaysOfWelsh challenge, I had successfully completed all 5 levels of "Present1" of Castle 1 of Duolingo's Welsh course. 
* Today, 12-18-2020, Duo's algorythm told me it was time to practice this skill again.  As such, I am writing notes about the terms and prahse/sentence structure using Welsh related to restoring this skill.

# Sentences in Welsh 
* Every verb can be used to make simple sentences in a standard way using forms of another verb, bod (meaning 'being' or 'to be'). We have already met two forms of bod:
        
        dw i - I am, and
        dych chi - you are
        
* Now we are learning:
        
          hoffi is one of several words meaning 'liking' or 'to like'
        
* To say 'I like', we link 'I am' (dw i) with 'liking' ('hoffi') using a small word which does not actually translate into English when it is used like this - yn. In this pattern, the basic word yn is changed to 'n if it follows a word ending in a vowel. So, 'I like' is made up of:

         dw i + yn + hoffi

* giving us (remembering that yn => 'n after a vowel):

        dw i'n hoffi... - I like...

* Note how dw i and 'n join together.

* And so, following the same idea but this time using dych chi (you are), we get:

        Dych chi'n hoffi... - You like...

* So, what do you and I like? Coffee, perhaps, and the Welsh for 'coffee' is coffi:

        Dw i'n hoffi coffi - I like coffee
        Dych chi'n hoffi coffi - You like coffee

(Note that although 'n/yn here is not actually translated into English, it does act as a marker showing that the action is 'in progress', unfinished. Later in the course you will find other words used instead of 'n/yn to mark completed or newly completed actions.)

# Saying NOT or DON'T 
The usual word for 'not' in Welsh is ddim:

    Dw i ddim... - I am not...

So,

    Dw i ddim yn hoffi... - I do not like...

Note that yn is separated from dw i ddim by a space - it does not get changed to 'n. That is because ddim ends with a consonant, not a vowel.

    Dw i ddim yn hoffi coffi. - I don't like coffee.
    Dych chi ddim yn hoffi coffi. - You do not like coffee.

Note that Welsh makes no distinction here between the English 'do not' and 'don't.'

# QUESTION if something is liked or not
With dw i... and dych chi..., we can turn them into questions just by lifting our tone of voice at the end of the sentence, as we do when asking a question in English:

    Dych chi'n hoffi selsig? - Do you like sausages?
    Dw i'n hoffi coffi? - Do I like coffee?

# Some dialect variations

Welsh has a number of dialects; four or five main ones, with large areas of geographical overlap. Different generations also tend to use different language patterns, too, just as with any modern language. You may live in one of those areas and you may already be learning some slight variations from the forms we generally use on this course. Don't worry about it, just ask your local tutor for advice if this applies to you.

One common variation is in a phrase we introduce in this section - dych chi (you are). In parts of north-west Wales in particular you may be learning this as dach chi, which reflects a local pronunciation. All the way through this course you can respond with dach chi instead of dych chi if you wish. Later in the course you will also meet dach chi being used as a prompt. It is important to become familiar with some simple dialect variations as they do come up in the national media and you will hear them all over Wales because people travel around so much - we don't change the way we speak just because we are working and living in or visiting a different area. There is some more information about the Welsh dialects in the notes for the later section called 'Dialects'.

Note that in this introductory course we do not cover many dialect variations, just those few commonly taught in the two introductory levels in courses for adults in Wales under the national 'LearnWelsh' scheme (www.learnwelsh.cymru).
