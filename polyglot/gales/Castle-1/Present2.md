Present 2
Some more examples of 'doing things' in Welsh

A number of other words, both verbs and nouns, are introduced in this unit so that you can start building up your vocabulary. Building a wide vocabulary is essential in learning a language, and there are many tools around to help you.

In this unit, all the verbs are presented in the present tense. For example:

    Dw i'n hoffi - I like
    Dw i'n yfed - I drink/I am drinking
    Dw i'n hoffi yfed te - I like to drink tea

Remember that the 'to' in 'to drink' in the third example is included in the meaning of the single Welsh word yfed. Yfed means 'drinking' or 'to drink', so no additional Welsh word is needed for the 'to' in this pattern.

yn is used to link dw i etc to the following verb. It is usual to shorten it to'n when it follows a Welsh vowel (a e i o u w y). This is normal for any positive sentence. When using a negative sentence, the yn is always full and again comes just before the verb-noun. For example:

    Mae e'n yfed - He is drinking or He drinks
    Dw i'n yfed- I am drinking or I drink
    Dw i ddim yn yfed - I am not drinking or I don't drink
    Dw i ddim yn gwneud te - I am not making tea

Cinio - lunch or dinner

Just as the basic structure of Welsh is very different from that of English - as in something as basic as word order, for example - Welsh words and English word do not always have a one-for-one translation. In this section you will meet an example - cinio - which is used for both 'lunch' and 'dinner'.

In English, different people use different terms for the various meals of the day. This course does not try to address that, but it is consistent in translating the various terms:

    brecwast - breakfast
    cinio - lunch or dinner (regardless of whether you use the term 'dinner' for a midday or an evening meal)
    te - tea
    swper - supper

Verb-nouns

The basic, dictionary-form of a verb in Welsh (hoffi, yfed, prynu, etc) is known as a verb-noun (berfenw). As you will see later in the course, verb-nouns can be used very flexibly in Welsh.

The nearest equivalent in English is the 'ing-participle' form of verbs (liking, drinking, buying, etc) but it is often also translated as the 'to-infinitive' (to like, to drink, to buy, etc).

In a dictionary, a verb-noun is often idenitifed with the abbreviation be for 'berfenw'.
Translating standalone verb-nouns

Please note that on this course, if you are asked to translate a verb-noun on its own (for example, bwyta, hoffi, yfed, etc), and not as part of a longer phrase, you should use the forms 'xxxing' or 'to xxx'. ('eating', 'to eat', 'to like', 'drinking'). Do not answer with just 'xxx' (eat, like, drink, swim, etc) as those forms can often be mixed up with nouns (a swim, a drink, ...) or commands (eat!, drink!). When you look them up in a dictionary the distinction is made clear, but we cannot do that on Duo.
Welsh pronouns

In colloquial Welsh, verbs are usually followed by their associated subject pronouns, for example dw i, dych chi, (I am, you are), etc.

(In formal Welsh the pronouns are often dropped, but we do not use or accept formal registers of Welsh on this course.)

For reference, here is a table of the usual pronouns:
Cymraeg 	English 	Notes
i 	I, me 	sometimes fi
ti 	you 	informal singular
e or o 	he, him 	e in southern dialects, o in northern dialects; sometimes fe, fo
hi 	she, her 	
ni 	we, us 	
chi 	you 	plural, and formal singular
nhw 	they, them 	

You will meet the verb-forms that go with each of these later in the course.
