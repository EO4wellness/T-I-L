# Saying "Going to" NOTES

## MYND I
A simple way of expressing the future using mynd i

To say that someone is 'going to' somewhere or to do something, the verb mynd i (going to, to go to) can be used, just as in English.

For example, 'going to' a place:

    Dw i'n mynd i Abertawe - I am going to Swansea
    Dych chi'n mynd i Aberdaron - You are going to Aberdaron

Note that mynd i is not used for 'going to' a person (going to the doctor, for example). For that, we use mynd at.

By putting mynd i in front of another verb-noun, it can be used to form a statement of someone's current intention to carry out a future action, just as in English. For example:

    Dw i'n mynd i siarad. - I am going to speak.
    Dw i'n mynd i arddio. - I am going to do some gardening. (garddio)
    Dw i'n mynd i godi. - I am going to get up. (codi)
    Dw i'n mynd i fynd i'r Eisteddfod. - I'm going to go to the Eisteddfod. (mynd)

## Soft mutation

You may have heard of mutations in Welsh. These are changes to some initial consonants of words in certain circumstances. Only nine consonants can take a mutation at all, and not all of them take every mutation. In the paragraph above, you have just seen some examples of the most common mutation, the 'soft' mutation (y treiglad meddal), that can apply to all nine mutatable consonants.

There are perhaps 30-40 causes of a soft mutation, only the most common of which are covered on this introductory course. In this section, it is the preposition i (to, for) which causes soft mutation of the word that directly follows it. For example, you will see above that garddio has changed to arddio following mynd i, codi to godi and mynd to fynd.

        Here is a table showing the soft mutations:
        original letter 	soft mutation
        p- 	                b-
        t- 	                d-
        c- 	                g-
        b- 	                f-
        d- 	                dd-
        g- 	                -
        m-              	f-
        ll-             	l-
        rh-             	r-

Remember that dd, ll and rh are all single letters in Welsh (along with ch, ff, ng, ph, th).

Note that when g- takes a soft mutation it vanishes, and that both b- and m- take a soft mutation to f-.

Don't worry if you cannot remember the mutations very easily at this stage - it will take a lot of practice for them to become natural to you. Keep a copy of the table to hand as you go through the course.

## Church vs Chapel

This unit introduces the word capel (chapel). The chapel movement was very strong in Wales. The influence of the established Church of England diminished, and in recent centuries the local non-conformist chapel became the primary location of Christian worship in many places. This was formalised in 1920, when the Church of England was disestablished in Wales and the 'Church in Wales' was created as a separate Anglican body with no links to civil government.

As a result, "chapel" and "church" are not synonymous in Wales.
Going to the usual place

When we are referring to places that we go to habitually, such as 'bed, 'chapel', 'work', 'school' etc, it is the convention in Welsh that i'r... ('to the...') is used. English is not so consistent in this:

        Mae Siân yn mynd i'r gwely - to bed
        Dw i'n mynd i'r capel bob bore Sul. - I go to chapel every Sunday morning.
        Mae'r plant yn mynd i'r ysgol. - The children are going to school.
        Mae Mair yn mynd i'r ymarfer côr ar nos Lun. - Mair goes to choir practice on Monday evenings.
        Mae e'n mynd i'r swyddfa. - He is going to the office.

When we do things on particular days

When we want to say that we are doing something 'on Monday', 'on Sunday' and so on, we usually simply change dydd to ddydd - there is no need to add anything else to mean 'on' in this case:

       Dw i'n mynd i Aber ddydd Llun. - I'm going to Aber on Monday.
       Ddydd Sadwrn, mae'r plant yn mynd i nofio. - The children are going swimming on Saturday.

To say 'on Mondays', 'on Monday evenings' when we mean we do something habitually on a Monday, on a Tuesday evening and so on, we use ar as well:

       Mae'r plant yn mynd i nofio ar nos Iau - the children go swimming on Thursday evenings
        Dw i'n mynd i Aber ar ddydd Llun - I go to Aber on Mondays

Note that ar causes a soft mutation:

       ar + dydd => ar ddydd.

## Sports

Some sports may not be familiar to people from outside Britain - they are all explained at length on the web..

In British English, when there is a well-known sporting event coming up it is usual for it to be referred to as simply 'the rugby', 'the golf', 'the athletics', etc:

      Wyt ti'n mynd i wylio'r rygbi heno? - Are you going to watch the rugby this evening?


# Lesson Review 
A note about review.  Originally, I started with Duolingo to learn more about what is (and isn't) possible with AI these days.  I wanted to see for myself what was possible.  When reseraching about Use Cases for A.I. I came across Duolingo and started using it.  Quickly, I noted the method was the SAME as what was used in school--many decades ago.  Also, it uses AI to quiz and test you.  This lesson, was a GREAT reminder of that!  I had completely forgotten most of this lesson.  The AI told me it was time to review.  I could not agree more!
