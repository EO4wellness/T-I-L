## 1. Croeso i'r Gymraeg! / Welcome to Welsh! 
1.1 Aims of the course:
The main aim of Croeso is to teach you basic Welsh and to provide you with some cultural knowledge about Wales and other areas where Welsh is spoken. This course will give you an opportunity to begin reading, writing speaking and listening to Welsh.

1.2 Which variety of Welsh is taught in Croeso?
While Wales has long had a standard literary language, no standard spoken form has been imposed and a speaker of Welsh will display certain dialect traits when speaking. While there are differences between east and west, the major distinction is between north and south. The divergences occur gradually rather than there being any clear demarcation line. Variations occur in pronunciation, the choice of words and in a few grammatical structures. Croeso teaches a form of Welsh from South Wales. Students on the full Croeso course can access written and spoken examples of northern Welsh on the course website.

1.3 How this course is structured
This course consists of sessions 2, 3 and 4 taken from the first course of L196 Croeso. Each session (Sesiwn) consists of a number of activities (named Ymarfer - exercise) to develop your reading, writing, speaking and listening skills in Welsh. You will also find some sections headed Ymarfer pellach (further practice), and at the end of sessions 3 & 4 a vocabulary list (Geirfa) followed by a grammar summary (Gramadeg).

A pdf transcript accompanies each audio track.

These main sessions are followed by additional reading and writing practice sessions 2, 3 and 4. You can choose to complete the additional practice material immediately after each corresponding Sesiwn, or you may wish to leave them all for revision at the end of the course.
