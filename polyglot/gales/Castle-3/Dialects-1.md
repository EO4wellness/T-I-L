## 'Identification' sentences

When we want to say what or who someone is - their name, their occupation or whether they are male or female and so on, this is termed an 'identification sentence'.

    I'm Dewi
    He is a teacher
    Sioned is a mechanic
    She is a girl

Remember that in Welsh, identification sentences use the emphatic construction, with the 'identity' being put first in the sentence.

Remember that with the third person verb this means that the 'identity' is followed by ydy/yw, never by mae:

    Dewi dw i
    Athro ydy o
    Mecanig yw Sioned
    Geneth ydy hi - (geneth - girl)
    Pobydd dych chi - (pobydd - baker)

The five main Welsh dialect areas

A variety of dialects are used in the Welsh-language media, so it is useful to become at least a little familar with some of the main variants as you start to learn the language.

Although people often refer to there being two main variants of Cymraeg, this greatly over-simplifies the reality. There are four or five commonly-recognised main dialect areas (see more below).

The five generally recognised dialects are:

    y Wendodeg - north-west Wales
    y Bowyseg - north-east and northern mid-Wales
    Iaith Sir Benfro - north Pembrokeshire Welsh
    y Ddyfedeg - southern mid-Wales and south-west Wales (Dyfed)
    Y Wenhwyseg - south and south-east Wales

A map of four of the five the main dialect areas is here although it includes the north Pembrokeshire dialect as part of the Dyfedeg dialect.

The dialect areas are not at all as distinct as the map may imply, and in many areas you may hear several words in use for the same thing, and several variations in the details of grammar. These often vary by the age of the person speaking, particularly as younger people tend to move around more for work and education, with the result that their language can tend to mix dialects and to standardise.

For examples of the actual complexity on the ground, look at examples such as these, which, although they cover only the vocabulary and not local variations in pronunciation and grammar, emphasise the lack of clear-cut dialect boundaries:

    Words for cowshed
    Words for gate

There are local dialect words and pronunciations for such everyday things as girl, boy, hedge, farm lane and so on. Milk can be llaeth, llâth, llefrith. Large/big is usually mawr, but pronounced /mowr/ in much of the south-west.

Here are some variations for 'table', 'grass', and 'iron': https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz6oFM0_Iszwucu8_lmEhmk44elcxCCgB

Adre ('homewards') is often pronounced /adra/ in the north-west and the south-east and as /adre/ elsewhere, but it sometimes appears as tua thre (pronounced /sha thre/) in the south and south-east.

-au endings (eg dechrau, cefnau) are often pronounced /-a/, (/dechra, cefna/) in the north-west and south-east, but /-e/ (/dechre/, /cefne/) in the north-east, mid-Wales and the south-west.

Cael might be heard as /câl/ in the south-west and /ciêl, ciel/ in mid-Wales.

Roedd hi'n oer may be heard as /wedd hi'n wer/ in Pembrokeshire.

Gwybod is often /gwpod/ in south-east Wales, and dw i ddim yn gwybod tends to be sa i'n gwpod.
