Extend

This section of the course introduces some additional vocabulary.
Hungry and thirsty

In Welsh the idea of being hungry or thirsty is expressed by 'a want' of 'food/drink' using the word eisiau (a want) in along with bwyd/diod (food/drink):

    Dych chi eisiau bwyd. - You are hungry.
    Dw i eisiau diod. - I am thirsty.

A reminder of the full present tense of bod (to be)

Here is the full pattern of the present tense of bod - dw i, etc, again:
Positive 	Question 	Negative 	Translation
[ry)dw i 	(y)dw i? 	(dy)dw i ddim 	I am, Am I?, I am not
rwyt ti 	wyt ti? 	dwyt ti ddim 	You (sing) are.. etc.
mae e/o 	ydy e/o? 	dydy e/o ddim 	He is....etc.
mae hi 	ydy hi? 	dydy hi ddim 	She is....etc.
(ry)dyn ni 	ydyn ni? 	(dy)dyn ni ddim 	We are.... etc.
(ry)dych chi 	(y)dych chi? 	(dy)dych chi ddim 	You (pl) are.... etc.
maen nhw 	ydyn nhw? 	(dy)dyn nhw ddim 	They are....etc

(ry)dw i shows the full written form in brackets (rydw i) compared to the spoken form taught on this course (dw i).

Remember that mae is also used with nouns, both singular and plural:

    Mae'r dyn yn mynd adre. - The man is going home.
    Mae'r dynion yn mynd adre. - The men are going home
    Mae'r plant yn mynd adre. - The children are going home.
    Mae Siôn a Siân yn mynd adre. - Siôn and Siân are going home.

Home, at home, to home

There are three words to learn concerning home:

    cartre - a home
    gartre - at home
    adre - (towards) home, home(wards) - used to convey some sort of movement towards or arrival at home.

All three will also be seen with a final -f, although it is rarely pronounced in colloquual Welsh.

    Mae cartre Dewi yn Aber. - Dewi's home is in Aber.
    Mae Dewi yn aros gartre heddiw. - Dewi is staying at home today.
    Mae Sioned yn cerdded adre. - Sioned is walking home.
    *Mae Sioned yn cyrraedd adref erbyn saith o'r gloch fel arfer. - Sioned usually gets home by seven o'clock.
