# SLOVAK LANGUAGE STUDIES 
My language studies of Slovakian aren't too serious, as Duolingo (or another free-online resource) is not yet available to study.  What is available is Mondly's daily (less than 5 minute) study practice sessions. I've been doing them daily, as well as the weekly and monthly quizzes, since April 6, 2020. I've only missed 1 day of study since then, which was July 13, 2020.
