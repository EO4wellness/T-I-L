Great study session today.  Here are the words and sentences I studied.

and here are the overall stats of this current 165 day streak.  so far i missed one day of lessons in the middle of july--otherwise I've done at least one lesson every day all year long

While all of the stats are interesting, they don't tell the story of learning a language, some some data about it.
From my point of view
* I'm feeling like I really can speak (at least the words I do know) fairly well 
* I'm learning from my mistakes
* I'm fairly consistent
* I enjoy this course of study.
