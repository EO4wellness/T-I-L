# Introduction
The road to code is not built in one day.<br>
**The road to polyglot, likewise, is not built in one day.**<br> 
_with both skill sets, consistent practice pays off in the long run_
and that, my friend, is what this section of my Today I Learned is all about
...plus it gives me a chance to pracice my GIT (somedays) and GITHUB (Other days) skills
and . . . my mark down and other skills

-[x] Britsh English vs. American English. NOTE:  I discovered again today, and keep re-discovering every few months or so, I'm also learning a bit of British English.  Mondly, the app, has all of the "English" translations in British English.  Thus the word Tyre instead of Tire, Theatre instead of Theater, and [Car Park vs Parking lot](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/polyglot/images/british-english.jpg).

# Why?
Why not! Those who can: do. Those who cannot: don't.

This repository also gives me a chance to practice MarkDown formatting, as well as daily coding in Markdown, as well as using commands & features of Git and GitHub, while at the same time serving as a type of log of my language learning activities--although I'm only sharing some of my daily language-learning activities here, not all of them. 

Additionally, I always found it fascinating at University, when the professors or historical texts would note that certain cultures or people groups were "traced" throughout history by linguistics. Thus, I audited the [Miracles of Human Language: An Introduction to Linguistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-language) Coursera course to learn more about this aspect of Human History.

## Curious Facts
Duolingo has several "leagues" and each week you either advance to the next level up, stay at the same level, or decline to a lower level. I've ben in each league and won advancement to each league, and I've also allowed myself to be demoted to all of the various levels.  I've won 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place once thru each league and now I'm not concerned about the leagues, other than it is a measure of how much time you've spent that week working on your language lessons. The leagues in order are: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Sapphire, Ruby, Emerald, Amethyst, Pearl, Obsidian and Diamond
