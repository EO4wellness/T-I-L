Mini Introduction

ADDING THE GREEK ALPHABET TO YOUR KEYBOARD Links to change your keyboard to use both Latin and Greek characters.

Accents

Modern Greek has only ONE accent mark and it is only on vowels.
i.e. ά, έ, ή, ί, ό, ύ, ώ.
The accent goes on one of the three last syllables.
Accents indicate where to put the emphasis when saying the word. Most one syllable words do not have accents.
Do note, there some cases where you DO need an accent as it makes a huge difference in the meaning.
To use the accent mark : press the semicolon key and then the vowel.

Μαρία (like marEEa)
καρότο' (like karooto) : carrot

Capital letters have accents ONLY on the first letter of a word. Άννα Accents for capital letters are omitted for all other places..
καρότο/ ΚΑΡΟΤΟ : carrot
βάζο / ΒΑΖΟ : vase.
Punctuation Marks

The Period or full stop, the comma and the exclamation mark are the same as English. The Greek question mark looks just like the English semicolon ; and can be found on the Q key when you are on the Greek keyboard.
Useful words

και : and
ναι : yes
είναι : it is
Note

Modern Greek is pronounced differently to the varieties of ancient Greek. This course teaches modern Greek.

# Study Session
* Began this skill set on Feb 18, 2021. 
* Prior to visiting the course today, this language and its skill sets looked different.
* Apparently this is the first day of this new duolingo course. 
* I discovered the ABCs were now named "WarmUP' and I was back to the beginning of the course. 
* I did all of the WARM up tips and introductory lessons.  
* I scored a perfect score on all of them and earned my level up (Level 1)
* When I earned a crown (the first one in this new course) it added the new crown to my previous crowns (from the older Greek course)
* At the end of the session, I also unlocked skill set: S Triad and Which the?
