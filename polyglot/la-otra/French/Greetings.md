# Hello there!
* Like in English, some French greetings depend on the time of day. 

     Bonjour!  Good morning/Good afternoon
     Bonsoir!  Good evening! 
     
* If you're being casual, you can say Salt! any time of day 

    Salut!  Hi/Bye 
    
## How are you? 

Ça va
can be used both to ask how someone is doing and to answer the question!

Salut, ça va ?
Hi, how are you?
Ça va, et toi ?
I'm fine, and you?
