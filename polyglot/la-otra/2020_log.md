I'm not certain I'm ready to move on to the next level (words/vocab/grammer/sentences) yet or reset my progress and start over until I receive 100% accuracy on the non-alphabet letters/sounds. If I do press on, this will be my [next goal/milestone](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/polyglot/la-otra/images/2020-12-26_next-milesone.png).
