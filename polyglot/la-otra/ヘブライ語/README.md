# Language History
* This is one of the "first" languages I'd ever studied. 
* It was the native tongue of one of my in-law great aunts and she "wanted me" to learn it.  :hotsprings:
* :hotsprings: . . .  need I say more?  
* I put "first language" in quotes because I failed to learn all of the non-alphabetical symbols! 
* I failed for decades!
* Tried. Failed. Tried. Failed. (repeat) 
* After traveling to the Middle East, I resumed studies. 
* Again, failure to learn the non-alphabetical symbols. 
* I tried duoligo.  
* Again, failure. 
* Finally, I learned the sounds in Mondly.
* Mondly seems to work BECAUSE for their non-alphabetical courses, they allow translitration to english letters! 
* In Mondly, you can switch from transliteration study or real language character study.
* Until recently, I've been doing 100% transliteration study to learn the sounds of the language and some "travel vocab"
* Mondly is really more of a vocabulary and "sounds" or "speaking" tool than a learning to read tool. 
* DuoLingo's course requires reading and writing skill set--which I'm still acquiring, so far without success. 
* I also have a VERY difficult time, even in transliteration, remembering the numbers in this language.  
* So far this is the only language I've had difficulty learning/remembering.
