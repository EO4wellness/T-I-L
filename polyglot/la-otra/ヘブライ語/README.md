# Language History
* This is one of the "first" languages I'd ever studied. 
* I put that in quotes because I failed to learn the non-alphabetical symbols. 
* After traveling to the Middle East, I resumed studies. 
* Again, failure to learn the non-alphabetical symbols. 
* I tried duoligo.  
* Again, failure. 
* Finally, I learned the sounds in Mondly who allows translitration to english letters!
