# Language Studies:
* The information in this section are for languages I have studied, but not too serious.  
* However, at any given time, one or more of these languages may spark my curiosity to study it more indepth. 
* This section is evolving.  
* Several of the languages I've studied here have gone from one interest level to another.

### NOTES:
In the future, I've always wanted to learn: Greek, Arabic, Hindi. Also, briefly, when Duo offered klingon as a study language, I began studying Klingo.  I was successful at passing several of the beginner levels; however, I removed the stats and the course from my list of studied languages as the course wasn't yet developed enough to get the bugs out.  Beta testing is wonderful, but at this time, I'm learning enough other topics, that I'm holding off on Klingon for now. . .
