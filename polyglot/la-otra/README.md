### NOTES:


other non-alphabetical - From time-to-time, I also study other languages. In particular, I've been trying to learn one non-alphabetical language for several decades with on-again/off-again effort.  Recently, I've resumed my effort(s) after studying it for about a year, consistently with a daily 5-minute or less listening to the language and using transliterations into English alphabet (instead of the languages native symbols. I am not able to understand *some native speach* somewhat--but I don't know the language very well and at this point I'm completely illiterate in this language.
