Feminine
Gender: Feminine

Every noun in Czech has a gender, which can be "masculine", "feminine", or "neuter". Knowing the gender is important because it impacts the form of the noun and even other words in the sentence. For inanimate things, there is little relation between their gender and their nature. For example "čaj" (tea) is masculine, "káva" (coffee) is feminine, and "mléko" (milk) is neuter. For words that refer to people, the grammatical gender and biological sex usually do coincide.

It may be possible to guess the gender of the noun from its ending:

    Nouns ending in a consonant are mostly masculine. Other examples include "kluk" (boy), "muž" (man), "chléb" (bread), "stroj" (machine), and two proper names, "František" and "Matěj".
    Nouns ending in -a or -e are mostly feminine. Early examples include "holka" (girl), "žena" (woman, wife), "restaurace" (restaurant), "lžíce" (spoon), and two proper names, "Kateřina" and "Žofie".
    Nouns ending in -o are almost always neuter. Other examples include město (city), "auto" (car), "jablko" (apple), and "maso" (meat).
    Nouns that end in -ě or -í are also often neuter. Early examples include "dítě" (child), "letiště" (airport), and "náměstí" (square, plaza).

Unfortunately, many nouns do not conform. Let's list a few taken from our early skills:

    Some nouns that end in a consonant are feminine, e.g., "věc" (thing), "sůl" (salt), "mrkev" (carrot), "myš" (mouse), and "postel" (bed).
    Some nouns that end in -a are masculine, e.g., "táta" (dad) and "turista" (tourist).
    Some nouns that end in -e are neuter, e.g., "zvíře" (animal) and "vejce" (egg).

Adjectives

We encountered our very first Czech adjective in the initial skill as part of "dobrý den" (a polite greeting). This adjective and others like it have endings that depend on the gender as follows:

    -ý in masculine, e.g., "dobrý čaj" (good tea)
    -á in feminine, e.g., "dobrá káva" (good coffee)
    -é in neuter, e.g., "dobré mléko" (good milk)

The adjectives we will be using in this skill (listed in their feminine forms) are:

    "dobrá" (good)
    "malá" (little, small)
    "mladá" (young)
    "nová" (new)
    "stará" (old)
    "velká" (big, large)

Demonstratives

Czech doesn't have articles, so "mladá žena" could be "young woman", "a young woman", or "the young woman", depending on context. Czech has a variety of ways of making clear which is meant when the distinction is important, including the word order. Here we only examine the demonstrative adjective (technically pronoun, but used before its noun like an adjective) that is sometimes used in place of the definite article. This demonstrative has the following forms:

    "ten" in masculine, e.g., "ten muž" (the/that man)
    "ta" in feminine, e.g., "ta žena" (the/that woman)
    "to" in neuter, e.g., "to dítě" (the/that child)

Demonstrative adjectives and regular adjectives can usually be combined, in that order: "ta mladá žena" (the/that young woman).
Pronunciation notes

The comments below build on the tips provided with the first two skills. Please make sure to review them as needed.

You may notice what appears to be a new vowel:

    ů is just a different spelling of the long ú. They sound the same. The rule is to spell as ú at the beginning of the word or of the word root following a prefix, and as ů otherwise.

Our word is "sůl" (salt), where the vowel starts neither the word nor its root (being internal to the root, which makes up the entire word), so we use ů.

Several new consonants appear in this skill:

    c represents a sound that doesn't quite exist in English, but it is very close to the "ts" at the end of "cats". It is, however, closer to a single sound rather than a sequence of two.
    č is like the "ch" in "chicken".
    h is like the "h" in "hotel". It is voiced.
    l is as in English.
    v is as in English. It is voiced.

This skill includes an example of a voiced consonant, "v", appearing at the end of a word, "mrkev". Such consonants are typically pronounced as if they were devoiced. The devoiced counterpart of "v" is "f", and so "mrkev" ends up sounding like "mrkef", a word that does not really exist in Czech any other way.

We have already seen that what consonant shows up before ě impacts the way the combination is pronounced:

    When ě follows d, t, or n, the pronunciation changes the consonant to a d', t', or ň (resp.) followed by a plain e.
    When ě follows any other consonant (excepting m), the consonant the ě is pronounced like the "y" in "yellow".

And that's why "věc" sounds like "vyec".
