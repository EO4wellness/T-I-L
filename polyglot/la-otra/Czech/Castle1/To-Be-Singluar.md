To Be Or Not To Be, Singular
To be: Singular

In this skill we keep on describing objects and living beings, including animals. We learn the missing pieces to complete this table:
Czech 	English
(Já) jsem 	I am
(Ty) jsi 	You are (informal singular)
(On/Ona/To) je 	He/She/It is
(Já) nejsem 	I am not
(Ty) nejsi 	You are not (informal singular)
(On/Ona/To) není 	He/She/It is not

Czech verbs are usually negated by adding ne- to the front. The irregular "není" is a rare exception.

The "ty" forms of the pronoun and the verb are informal singular, meaning they are used to address single individuals with whom we are on a first name basis or who are much younger than us.

Czech subject pronouns are normally optional, so the table shows them in parentheses. Two of these pronouns normally refer to animate subjects, "on" to masculine animates like "muž" and "ona" to feminine animates like "žena". For inanimates/neuters, we can skip the pronoun or use "to". We have seen enough "to" to need a review.
Pronoun "to"
Demonstrative "to": "To dítě je malé."

Here "to" functions as something between the definite article and the demonstrative adjective "that" for singular neuter nouns. For example, + To dítě je malé. (The/That child is small).

Both "the" and "that" are usually recognized in translations. The course currently does not allow translations with "this" where "the" can be used in English. Czech has another word for "this" when attached to a noun.

The demonstrative that can be translated as "the" must agree with the gender of the noun it is attached to just like it did in "To dítě je malé.":

    Ten kluk je malý. (The/That boy is small.)
    Ta holka je Kateřina. (The/That girl is Kateřina.)

Introduction "to": "To je Matěj"

The "to" in introductions like

    To je Kateřina/Matěj. (That/This is Kateřina/Matěj.)

does not change to agree with the noun gender.

Here "to" is usually the first word and is mostly translated as "that" or "this" (never "the"). These introductions are not limited to introducing people by name and can be negative. Either "that" or "this" is usually shown in the best translation, but subject pronouns (he, she, it) are usually also recognized:

    To je/není malá hruška. (That/This/It is/not a small pear.)

Make sure you notice the pattern: When "the" makes sense in English, "to" must agree with the noun gender in Czech (and cannot be translated as "this"). When "the" does not make sense, "to" is unchanging across noun genders (and can be translated as "this"). "That" typically works in all translations of "ten", "ta", and "to" in the singular.
2nd place "to": "Je to malé zvíře."

We now add a slightly different "to". It is similar to the introduction/pointing kind, but rather than pointing, we are just referencing someone/something previously discussed or understood to be the conversation topic:

    Je/Není to starý muž. (He is/not an old man.)
    Je/Není to starý stroj. (It is/not an old machine.)
    Je/Není to mladá žena. (She is/not a young woman.)
    Je/Není to malé dítě. (He/She/It is/not a little child.)

This "to" prefers the second place in the sentence but remains its subject. Again, "the" does not work as a complete subject of the sentence, so our "the" gender agreement rule says that "to" does not change to agree with the noun gender. This "to" is best translated as a subject pronoun (he, she, it), although "this" and "that" are usually also recognized.
Noun-less "to": "To je velké."

Our "the" test says that because "the" does not work in English, "to" does not change to reflect the noun gender. Here we have no noun, just an unattached adjective looking for something to agree with, and it only finds the "to", which then reverts to its singular neuter role. As before, "to" can go first or second:

    Je/Není to nové. (It is/not new.)
    To je/není nové. (That/This is new.)

Yes/no questions

Written Czech yes/no questions often look just like statements ending in a question mark. Compare "Jsi holka? " with "Jsi holka." Spoken questions of this type differ from the corresponding statements in intonation, which should rise at the end for yes/no questions but fall for statements. (Our synthetic voice is bad at this.)
Pronunciation notes

    "Dlouhý" presents the one two-vowel sequence frequently found in domestic words, "ou", pronounced by gliding from one vowel to the next.
    "Had" is another example of the final consonant devoicing. The devoiced counterpart of "d" is "t", so "had" sounds like "hat" (the English "hut").
    "Není" is an example of a domestic word with a "ní" sequence. The second n gets pronounced like ň, the sound we needed to pronounce "město" or "náměstí".
    "Ovce" presents a mixed voiced/devoiced consonant cluster. (Remember "kde"?) The last consonant is devoiced, so the preceding "v" gets pronounded as its devoiced mate "f", and the word sounds like "ofce".
