Masculine
Descriptions: Masculine

In this skill we learn a few words to describe people and things and get to see the grammatical gender in action.

Every noun in Czech has a gender: masculine, feminine, or neuter. Knowing the gender is important for choosing the form of the noun and even other words in the sentence. For inanimate nouns, there is little relation between their gender and their nature. For example "čaj" (tea) is masculine, "káva" (coffee) is feminine, and "mléko" (milk) is neuter. For nouns that refer to people, the grammatical gender and biological sex usually do coincide.

It may be possible to guess the gender of the noun from its ending:

    Nouns ending in a consonant are mostly masculine. Early examples include "kluk" (boy), "muž" (man), "chléb" (bread), "stroj" (machine), and the proper names "František", "Jakub", and "Matěj".
    Nouns ending in -a or -e are mostly feminine. Early examples include "holka" (girl), "žena" (woman, wife), "restaurace" (restaurant), "lžíce" (spoon), and the proper names "Jitka", "Kateřina", and "Žofie".
    Nouns ending in -o are almost always neuter. Early examples include město (city), "auto" (car), "jablko" (apple), and "maso" (meat).
    Nouns that end in -ě or -í are also often neuter. Early examples include "dítě" (child), "letiště" (airport), and "náměstí" (square, plaza).

Unfortunately, many nouns do not conform. Let's list a few taken from our early skills:

    Some nouns that end in a consonant are feminine, e.g., "věc" (thing), "sůl" (salt), "mrkev" (carrot), "myš" (mouse), and "postel" (bed).
    Some nouns that end in -a are masculine, e.g., "táta" (dad) and "turista" (tourist).
    Some nouns that end in -e are neuter, e.g., "zvíře" (animal) and "vejce" (egg).

Adjectives

We encountered our very first Czech adjective in the initial skill as part of the "dobrý den" greeting. This adjective and others like it have endings that depend on the gender of the noun they modify:

    -ý in masculine, e.g., "dobrý čaj" (good tea)
    -á in feminine, e.g., "dobrá káva" (good coffee)
    -é in neuter, e.g., "dobré mléko" (good milk)

The adjectives we will be using in this skill (listed in their masculine forms) are:

    "dobrý" (good)
    "malý" (little, small)
    "mladý" (young)
    "nový" (new)
    "starý" (old)
    "velký" (big, large)

Demonstratives

Czech doesn't have articles, so "mladý muž" could be "young man", "a young man", or "the young man", depending on context. Czech has a variety of ways of making clear which is meant when the distinction is important, including the word order. Here we only examine the demonstrative adjective (technically pronoun, but used before its noun like an adjective) that is sometimes used in place of the definite article. This demonstrative has the following forms:

    "ten" in masculine, e.g., "ten muž" (the/that man)
    "ta" in feminine, e.g., "ta žena" (the/that woman)
    "to" in neuter, e.g., "to dítě" (the/that child)

Demonstrative adjectives and regular adjectives can usually be combined, in that order: "ten starý muž" (the/that old man).
Pronunciation notes

The comments below build on the tips provided with the first two skills. Please make sure to review them as needed.

Several new consonants matter in this skill:

    ch is considered a single letter in Czech and is found after "h" in dictionaries. It is the unvoiced counterpart to h. The sound no longer exists in most dialects of English. Scots has retained it, for example in "Loch Ness".
    č is like the "ch" in "chicken".
    f is as in English (and an unvoiced counterpart to v)
    š is like the "sh" in "sheep" (and an unvoiced counterpart to ž).
    v is as in English. It is voiced.
    ž is like the sound that the "s" makes in "pleasure". It is voiced.

The "ti" in "František" gives us an example of another pronunciation interference between letters:

    In domestic Czech words, when followed by an i or í, d is pronounced like ď, t like ť, and n like ň.

This skill also includes two more examples of the final consonant devoicing, when a voiced consonant at the end of a word is pronounced as if it were devoiced (unless followed in the stream of speech by another voiced consonant):

    The "b" at the end of "chléb" gets pronounced as its devoiced mate "p", making the word sound like "chlép".
    The "ž" at the end of "muž" gets pronounced as its devoiced mate "š", making the word sound like "muš" (moosh).
