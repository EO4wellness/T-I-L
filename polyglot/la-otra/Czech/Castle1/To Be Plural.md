To Be Or Not To Be, Plural
To be, Plural

In this skill we continue describing people and things, but this time in groups. We need to learn the plurals of "je"/"není" and a few more pronouns:
Czech 	English
(My) jsme 	We are
(Vy) jste 	You are (plural/formal singular)
(Oni/Ony/To) jsou 	They are
(My) nejsme 	We are not
(Vy) nejste 	You are not (plural/formal singular)
(Oni/Ony/To) nejsou 	They are not

The "vy" forms of the pronoun and the verb both formal singular and plural, meaning they are used to address single individuals whom we should show respect as well as groups of individuals.

Two of the plural third-person pronouns are normally used to refer to animate subjects only, "oni" to masculine animates like "muži" and "kluci" and "ony" to feminine animates like "ženy" and "holky". This contrasts with English, where "they" can easily refer to frosted flakes for your breakfast. What happens with inanimate or neuter subjects? We usually rely on our favorite Czech word, "to", as shown below.

We will also need some plural nouns and adjectives, along with the matching forms of the demonstrative.
Nouns

We learn a few plural nouns:
Czech 	English
muž > muži 	man > men
kluk > kluci 	boy(s)
strom > stromy 	tree(s)
pomeranč > pomeranče 	orange(s)
žena > ženy 	woman > women
holka > holky 	girl(s)
hruška > hrušky 	pear(s)
restaurace 	restaurant(s)
dítě > děti 	child(ren)
zvíře > zvířata 	animal(s)
jablko > jablka 	apple(s)
vejce 	egg(s)

This sampling previews some of the plural noun formation possibilities in Czech. A few initial observations:

    Animate masculine nouns ending in a consonant in the singular often append -i to form the plural, e.g., we get "muži" and "kluci". Note the written consonant shift from "k" to "c" before the -i ending.
    Inanimate masculine nouns usually append -y or -e to form the plural, e.g., we get "stromy" and "pomeranče".
    Feminine nouns ending in -a in the singular replace the -a with -y, e.g., "ženy" and "hrušky".
    Feminine nouns ending in -e/ě in the singular stay that way in the plural, e.g., "restaurace" (restaurant/restaurants).
    Neuter nouns ending in -o in the singular replace the -o with an -a, e.g., "jablka".
    Some neuter nouns ending in -e/ě in the singular replace the -e/ě with -ata, e.g., "zvířata"; others do not change, like "vejce" (egg/eggs).
    The plural of the neuter "dítě" (child) shows that things are not always what they seem in Czech. Instead of the expected (but non-existent) neuter "díťata", we have the feminine plural "děti”.

Adjectives

In the plural, adjectives differ in endings between the genders predictably:

    -í in animate masculine, e.g., "mladí muži" (young men)
    -é in inanimate masculine, e.g., "velké stromy/pomeranče" (big trees/oranges)
    -é in feminine, e.g., "mladé ženy" (young women)
    -á in neuter, e.g., "malá zvířata" (small animals)

The consonant shift from "k" to "c" also impacts the animate masculine adjective before the -í ending. Thus we get "velcí kluci" (big boys).
Demonstratives

The Czech demonstrative that is sometimes used where the definite article could go in English has the following plural forms:

    "ti" in animate masculine, e.g., "ti muži" (the/those men)
    "ty" in inanimate masculine, e.g., "ty pomeranče" (the/those oranges)
    "ty" in feminine, e.g., "ty ženy" (the/those women)
    "ta" in neuter, e.g., "ta zvířata" (the/those animals)

We are starting to see that we need to deal with four Czech genders, not just the usual three.
Pronoun "to" (again?)

Remember the non-neuter uses of "to", like "To je velká hruška.", and our "the" test? The same thing happens in the plural:

    To ne/jsou velké hrušky. (Those/These are/not large pears.) ["The" does not work, so "to" stays unchanged regardless of the gender and number of the noun.]
    Ty hrušky ne/jsou velké. (The/Those pears are/not large.) ["The" is possible, so "to" must agree with the gender and number of the noun.]

Keep in mind

Because the singular neuter "dítě" switches to the feminine "děti" in the plural, the correct forms get some getting used to:

    Kde je to malé dítě?
    Kde jsou ty malé děti? [Kde jsou ta malá díťata? would be cute but wrong.]

The pronunciation of "děti" may be as challenging as that of "dítě". We had our first example of the "dě" sequence (pronounced as "ďe", where "ď" is roughly a "d"+"y" sequence merged into one sound half-way from "d" to "g") in "děkuju", and "ti" sounds like it does in "František" (where the "t" makes a "ť" sound, roughly a "t"+"y" sequence merged into one sound half-way from "t" to "k").
