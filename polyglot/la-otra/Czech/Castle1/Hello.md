The sounds of Czech

Czech is mostly phonetic. If you know how a word is written, you can usually determine how it is pronounced. The only words which don't follow the rules are recent loan words, but these are mostly taken from English, and so should be familiar. Conversely, if you know how a word is pronounced, you can usually figure out how it is written. The main exceptions are that i & y (as well as í & ý) and mě & mně are pronounced the same.

Most letters are pronounced more or less the same as in English. The following guidelines are approximate. You'll get a better idea from listening to the audio of the sentences.
Vowels

The vowels are as in most European languages.

    a is always like the a in father, never like the a in dad.
    e is as in let.
    i is as in kitten.
    o is as in gopher, but without the light w sound which usually follows it in English.
    u is as in put.
    y is always a vowel, never a consonant, and is indistinguishable from i in most contexts.

Each vowel has a short and a long form. The long forms are written á, é, í, ó, ú, and ý, except that ú is replaced by ů everywhere except at the start of a word (or at the start of the word's root after a prefix). The main difference between a short vowel and a long vowel is the length of time spent pronouncing it, except that i/y may undergo a quality change, possibly variable by region:

    í/ý is as the "ea" sound in cleat.

Consonants

Many consonants occur in pairs, voiced and unvoiced, like b and p, d and t, or z and s. Sometimes one of the pair is missing. There are also consonants like l and r which don't really fit into either category.
Voiced

    b is as in English
    d is mostly as in English but pronounced with the tongue closer to the teeth.
    ď is a sound that does not exist in English. It sounds roughly like a d followed by a consonantal y, but it is one sound rather than a combination of two. Unless you already know a Slavic or Celtic language, it may take you some time to learn to pronounce this correctly.
    g is as in English (not used much in Czech).
    h is as in English.
    v is as in English.
    z is as in English.
    ž is like the sound that the s makes in pleasure or leisure.

Unvoiced

    c represents a sound which doesn't quite exist in English, but it is very close to the ts as the end of cats. It is, however, a single sound rather than a combination of two.
    č is like the ch in chicken.
    f is as in English (not used much in Czech).
    ch is considered a single letter in Czech and is found after h in dictionaries. It is the unvoiced counterpart to h, a sound which no longer exists in most dialects of English. Scots has retained it, for example in Loch Ness.
    k is as in English, but a bit softer.
    p is as in English, but a bit softer.
    s is as in English.
    t is as in English, but with the tongue closer to the teeth.
    ť is the unvoiced counterpart to ď, and is similarly a sound which does not exist in English. It sounds roughly like a t followed by a consonantal y, but it is one sound rather than a combination of two.

Other

    j is like an English consonantal y, in other words like the y in yellow.
    l, m and n are as in English.
    ň is roughly like an n followed by a consonantal y, but it is one sound rather than a combination of two.
    r is lightly rolled, as in Spanish or Italian, or tapped, as in Scots.
    ř is a sound unique to Czech and is the sound the majority foreigners and some natives find most difficult to learn. It's roughly similar to the combination r+ž, but is a single sound.

Combinations

Unless mentioned explicitly below, each letter in Czech is simply pronounced independently of any letters which precede or follow it.

    Final consonants are often unvoiced. So a b at the end of a word is pronounced p, a d at the end of a word is pronounced t, etc.
    Groups of consonants in the same syllable are pronounced voiced or unvoiced, usually according to the last consonant in the group, so sb is pronounced zb, zt is pronounced st, etc.
    However, sh is usually pronounced sch instead of the zh one would expect from the "last consonant governs" rule. (Na shledanou should sound like "naschledanou". Our audio incorrectly says "nazhledanou", which is a regional exception.)
    As mentioned above, i and y are pronounced the same. However, an i/í (unlike a y/ý) impacts the pronunciation of three consonants if it follows them in a domestic word: When followed by an i/í, a d is pronounced like ď, a t like ť, and an n like ň.
    The letter ě is pronounced like a consonantal y followed by an e. When d, t, or n is followed by ě, the pronunciation is as if the consonant changed to a d', t', or ň (resp.) followed by an e. And mě sounds like mně.
