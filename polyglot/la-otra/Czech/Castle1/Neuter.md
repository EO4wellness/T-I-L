Neuter
Descriptions: Neuter

In this skill we learn a few more words to describe people and things and get to see the grammatical gender in action.

Please read the introductory gender notes in the neighboring Masculine skill. We need to save space here.
Adjectives

We encountered our very first Czech adjective in the initial skill as part of "dobrý den" (a polite greeting). This adjective and others like it have endings that depend on the gender as follows:

    -ý in masculine, e.g., "dobrý čaj" (good tea)
    -á in feminine, e.g., "dobrá káva" (good coffee)
    -é in neuter, e.g., "dobré mléko" (good milk)

The adjectives we will be using in this skill (listed in their neuter forms) are:

    "dobré" (good)
    "malé" (little, small)
    "mladé" (young)
    "nové" (new)
    "staré" (old)
    "velké" (big, large)

Demonstratives

Czech doesn't have articles, so "malé dítě" could be "small child", "a small child", or "the small child", depending on context. Czech has a variety of ways of making clear which is meant when the distinction is important, including the word order. Here we only examine the demonstrative adjective (technically pronoun, but used before its noun like an adjective) that is sometimes used in place of the definite article. This demonstrative has the following forms:

    "ten" in masculine, e.g., "ten muž" (the/that man)
    "ta" in feminine, e.g., "ta žena" (the/that woman)
    "to" in neuter, e.g., "to dítě" (the/that child)

Demonstrative adjectives and regular adjectives can usually be combined, in that order: "to malé dítě" (the/that small child).
Pronunciation notes

The comments below build on the tips provided with the first two skills. Please make sure to review them as needed.

Vowel sequences are not too common in Czech and usually show up in foreign-derived words. The example in "auto" shows that the Czech approach to vowel sequences in the same syllable is to simply glide from the first vowel to the next.

Several new consonants appear in this skill:

    c represents a sound that doesn't quite exist in English, but it is very close to the "ts" at the end of "cats". It is, however, closer to a single sound rather than a sequence of two.
    č is like the "ch" in "chicken".
    š is like the "sh" in "sheep" (and an unvoiced counterpart to ž).
    v is as in English. It is voiced.
    z is as in English. It is voiced.
    ž is like the sound that the "s" makes in "pleasure".

This skill also includes examples of the "mě" sequence in "město" and "náměstí". This is a good place to summarize the rules for pronouncing the Czech ě in general. The pronunciation effects of ě depend on what consonant it follows:

    When ě follows d, t, or n, the pronunciation changes the consonant to a d', t', or ň (resp.) followed by a plain e. Compare the sound of "dě" in "děkuju" with that of "de" in "dobrý den", and the sound of "tě" in "Matěj" with that of "te" in "Kateřina".
    When ě follows m, the pronunciation effect is as if we replaced the "mě" with "mně". In the end, we get something like a "mñe" sound.
    When ě follows any other consonant, we do not change the pronunciation of the consonant and just pronounce the ě like a consonantal "y" (the "y" in "yellow") followed by an e.

Finally, this skill also includes examples of "dí" and "tí" sequences. The rule for those is:

    In domestic Czech words, when followed by an i or í, d is pronounced like ď, t like ť, and n like ň (whose sounds we know from "děkuju", "Matěj", and "promiňte"). The vowel itself still sounds the same as y or ý.
