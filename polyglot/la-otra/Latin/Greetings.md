# Greetings 
* Began Study of Lesson: 1-24-2021. 


## Salve(te)!
* In Latin, we use salve to greet someone. 
* When you want to say hello to more than one person, you use salvete.
* Ave and avete are more formal greetings.


## Vocative
* Let's have a look at the following sentence.

      Salvete, Stephane et Marce!
      
* Stephanus and Marcus are being addressed in this case; 
you are saying "salvete" to Stephanus and Marcus. 
* Most* masculine words ending in -us (2nd declension) will get the ending -e in this situation. 
* Names ending in -a don't change. (Salve, Livia!)

* This is the vocative case, used for people being addressed.

    *Words ending in -ius, however, change to -i (not -e)

* When translating vocatives to English, we keep the nominative/normal form.


## Nomen mihi est
* This is the most common way to say "my name is". 
* For now, we will not go too deep into the grammar of this construction, 
but it is a useful phrase to know. Remember that Latin has no strict word order.

          Latin 	                |   English
          Nomen mihi est Marcus. 	|   My name is Marcus.
          Tibi nomen est Livia. 	| Your name is Livia.
          Nomen ei Lucius est. 	  | His name is Lucius.
          Nomen ei est Lesbia. 	  | Her name is Lesbia.
          
## How are you?
* You will learn two ways to ask how someone is doing in this skill.

          1) Quid + ago? -> Quid agis?
            Literally, this means "What are you doing?"
            
            SUBJECT:            |   VERB: 
            ego                 |   ago
            tu                  |   agis 
            is, ea              |   agit 
            
          2) Quomodo + se + habeo? -> Quomodo te habes?
              Literally, this means "How do you have 
              yourself/How do you feel?"

            SUBJECT:            |   VERB: 
            ego                 |   habeo 
            tu                  |   habes 
            is, ea              |   habet 
            
            Se is the reflexive pronoun. (-self in English)
            
            SUBJECT:            |   REFLEXIVE         |     English
            Pronoun                 Pronoun
            
            ego                 |     me              |   myself
            tu                  |     te              |   yourself
            is, ea              |     se              |   himself/herself
            
## Adverbs
* Bene (well) and male (badly) are adverbs. 
* Adverbs are words that give more information about verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. 
* In English these forms usually get -ly added, 
* while in Latin adverbs of 1st and 2nd declension adjectives end in -e.

    Bene dormio. - I sleep well. (and not "I sleep good.")
    
            
##  -ne
* You stick the suffix -ne to the first word of a sentence to indicate 
that it is a yes/no question. The -ne is not mandatory and can be omitted.

          Latin 	                  English           	Potential answers
          Estne Roma in Italia? 	  Is Rome in Italy? 	(Yes, it is./No, it is not.)
          Roma in Italia est? 	    Is Rome in Italy? 	(Yes, it is./No, it is not.)
          
## First conjugation (-are)
* Habitare/habito (to live somewhere, to reside) is a verb that follows the first conjugation. 
* You can recognize these verbs by the -a- in the verb stem. 
* (The -a- merges with the -o for the first person singular.)

          Subject 	Habitare 	Amare (to love) 	Stare (to stand) 	
           ego    	habito    	amo 	          sto 	
           tu 	    habitas 	  amas 	          stas 	
           is, ea 	habitat 	   ama t 	        stat
