# Castle 2
* As Japanese takes longer to learn, than other alphabetical-based lanagues (at least for me), I'm going slowly.
* I'm reviewing Castle 1 daily and trying to review ALL of Castle 1 lessons (as these are the basic sounds/characters)
* Then, I'm attempting to study one new lesson of Castle 2 a day, but sometimes I only do the review of Castle 1 without the new lessons.
* Started studying the Castle 2 topics on January 1st, 2021
