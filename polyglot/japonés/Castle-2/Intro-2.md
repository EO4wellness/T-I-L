# Introduction 2

## Basic Grammar

One thing that makes Japanese very different from English is the Japanese tendency to drop the subject of the sentence when the meaning is clear from context. Statements usually refer to oneself, while questions usually address the person you're speaking with.

### The Question Marker

Adding question marker か at the end will make the affirmative (positive) sentence into question. If the sentences end in ～です, it’s easy to formulate questions by using ～ですか。
        Positive 	Question
        アメリカ人です。(I’m American.) 	アメリカ人ですか。(Are you American?)
        がくせいです。(I’m a student.) 	がくせいですか。(Are you a student?)

### Pronouns

Pronouns are relatively rare in Japanese, but they are sometimes used to explicitly specify the subject or topic of a sentence. Below are some of the most common ones.
        Person 	Singular 	Plural
        First 	私・わたし is used in polite settings by women and men, used by women in most other settings. 僕・ぼく is used by men in informal settings. 	私たち・わたしたち is most common. 我々・われわれ sounds rather stiff and business-like.
        Second 	あなた is used in polite settings, however, if you know someone's name, it's best to call them by their name, typically followed by さん or せんせい。君・きみ is used by men in informal settings, specifically to those on or beneath one's social level. 	あなたたち is used in formal settings, and 君たち・きみたち is used in informal settings, especially to subordinates.
        Third - Male 	彼・かれ 	彼ら・かれら is also used for a mixed-gendered group
        Third - Female 	彼女・かのじょ 	彼女たち・かのじょたち
