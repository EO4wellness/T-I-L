## Object Particle
The marker を is attached to things or people, 
and means that they are the target of the verb. 
Subjects are often omitted in Japanese sentences. 
Unlike English, the location of the verbs are 
usually at the end of the sentence. 
を was once pronounced wo, 
but now it’s the [o] sound.
