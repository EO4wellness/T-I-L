# Introduction:
Began a #100-days-of-japaneese learning style log here in the example of: https://github.com/EO4wellness/100-days-of-code on December 1, 2020.  I'm not certain when I first began doing Japaneese lessons.  I believe it was in October, 2020.  

# LOGS 

* [2021 Studies](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/polyglot/japon%C3%A9s/logs/2021_log.md)

## Overall Progress:
* Initially I began the course, wondering "if I could do it" and discovered not only could I, apaprently, based on my scores, I'm good at it.  The discovery was delightful.  However, despite this, I was determined to GO SLOW.  Every time Duolingo offered to "level up" and skip lessons, I declined. Instead I took the slow approach to this langauge and have been learning everything very slowly.  I've not yet worked on my pronounciation.  I want to do so before moving to the next level, despite passing the first level, very quickly after beginning the daily log.  If you've happened upon this log of my learning and langauge studies and do not yet know the power of logging, I suggest you try it.  Daily logging increases your proficiency quickly, while decreasing your learning curve time axis.
