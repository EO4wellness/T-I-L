# [Intro to Japanese](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/blob/main/polyglot/japon%C3%A9s/intro.md) 日本語 
Acording to the various random facts accumulated online, Japanese is the 9th most popular language spoken in the world and about 130 million people currently speak it. Japanese is considered a a language isolate by linquists because it is a language which appears to be unrelated to other languages.

DuoLingo has an online English/Japanese dictionary.  They don't have "wellness" in the English/Japanese dictionary.  But they do have health, which is: 健康  So for the challenge to basically introduce yourself in Japanese, if I'm going to use my online repository name, it would be:  Watashi wa e o yo n kenkō (EO4Wellness) desu. といいます え お よん 健康
