        Here's a tip!
        Japanese has two alphabets, hiragana and katakana. 
        Each alphabet has 46 letters. 
        We use hiragana to write words of Japanese origin, and katakana to write borrowed vocabulary and foreign names. 
        There are also around 2000 frequently used characters (kanji). 



        Hiragana is used for words of Japanese origin. 
        
        Here's a tip!
        Both hiragana and katakana represent sounds, whilst kanji represents meanings. 
        We will start with hiragana, then move on to katakana, and finally conquer kanji! 
        Let's begin by learning the first 5 letters of hiragana: 
        あ (a), い (i), う (u), え (e), お (o). 
        The phonetic transcription written in Latin letters is called romaji.
