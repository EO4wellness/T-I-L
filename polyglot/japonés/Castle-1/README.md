# Castle 1 - Japaneese 
Started studying Japaneese, with Duolingo, just to see if I could learn an non alphabetical language, in the Fall of 2020.  

# Topics of Study:
Most of the first castle is devoted to learning the sounds of Hiragana, although there are more than a few vocabulary words, made from these sounds, included within the lessons too.

* Hiragana 1
* Hiragana 2 
* Hiragana 3
* Hiragana 4 
* Greetings 
* Katakana 1 
* Intro 1 
* Katakana 2
