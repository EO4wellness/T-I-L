Welcome to the Japanese course!

While many consider Japanese to be very difficult to learn for native English speakers, this is only partially true. Many aspects of the Japanese language are quite simple, such as the sound system, and yes, even most of the grammar.
Writing Systems

Japanese uses three different writing systems, hiragana, katakana, and kanji.

Hiragana is the most basic Japanese syllabary. It's like an alphabet that uses syllables instead of individual sounds.

Katakana is the syllabary used to write foreign words and some noises. Although it's different from hiragana, it represents the exact same syllables.

Kanji are Chinese characters used in the Japanese language to write individual nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Kanji are not phonetic, meaning you need to memorize each pronunciation individually. In this course, we introduce kanji gradually and methodically.
Hiragana Pronunciation

Below are the most basic forms of Japanese hiragana. We'll be introducing some more later as well.
Japanese 	IPA, Notes
あ 	[a]
い 	[i]
う 	[ɯ], like the oo in food
え 	[e]
お 	[o]
か 	[ka]
き 	[ki]
く 	[kɯ]
け 	[ke]
こ 	[ko]
さ 	[sa]
し 	[ɕi], like the shee in sheep
す 	[sɯ], although it can shorten to more of a [s] at the end of a word
せ 	[se]
そ 	[so]
た 	[ta]
ち 	[tɕi], like the tch in itchy
つ 	[tsɯ], like the ts in cats
て 	[te]
と 	[to]
な 	[na]
に 	[ni]
ぬ 	[nɯ]
ね 	[ne]
の 	[no]
は 	[ha], although pronounced like [ɰa] or "wa" as a particle
ひ 	[çi], like the h in human
ふ 	[ɸɯ], roughly between a short "hoo" and "foo"
へ 	[he], although pronounced like [e] or "eh" as a particle
ほ 	[ho]
ま 	[ma]
み 	[mi]
む 	[mɯ]
め 	[me]
も 	[mo]
や 	[ja]
ゆ 	[jɯ]
よ 	[jo]
ら 	[ɾa], like the t in the American pronunciation of butter
り 	[ɾi]
る 	[ɾɯ]
れ 	[ɾe]
ろ 	[ɾo]
わ 	[ɰa]
を 	[o], although it's most often romanized as "wo"
ん 	[n] or [ŋ], like the n in pink, producing a [m] when combined with a bilabial stop, hence "tempura" and not "tenpura"

As the only solitary consonant in hiragana, ん is especially notable because it is only found at the end of another syllable. In other words, you will never read a Japanese word that begins with ん。

Enjoy the course!
