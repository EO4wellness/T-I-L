## SCOPE OF STUDY:
Today, rather than take notes while studying, I just enjoyed learning, without recording the session in text. A mixture of both really helps!  The go-at-your-own-pace learning sessions are awesome fun, while still being effective.  But the record everything as you go, type up every word or sentence, also has its place in mastery of a new language. As in most things in life, a blance between the two is wonderful at producing excellent results. 

## STUDY STEPS:
Here are the results from today's learning session: 
* I worked on mastering Castle 1 - Katakana 1 skill set.  
* To begin with, I first reviewed each of the Castle 1 skill sets before Katakana 1.
* I earned 100% scores on each skill set except for the last one, where I made one mistake, and corrected it. 
* Then I committed to finishing the Katakana 1 skill set, as I've previously passed this level's final quiz, but haven't brought all of the individual skill sets to 100% completion and would like to aim to do so by the end of the 2020 year. 
* I brought Katakan 1 to level 2 completion and earned a crown and level 3 access.
* I worked through level 3 to earn the crown. 
* I worked through level 4 to earn the crown. 
* I am now at 100% completion of Katakan 1, and I did so at 100%!  Wow! I didn't make any mistakes thru the completion of level 2, 3, 4, or earning 5 today in this skill set.  It was super fun! 
* NOTE: The software kept telling me to "level up" (skip practice inbetween).  However, I have decided not to do that, even when offered, as I believe the practice helps, more than the "skip" or "pass" through too quickly. 

## RESULTS:

Level Up - You've aced this skill set:

## Done
* For the day.  
* Hope to carve out some personal time, later, to finish the other two remaining skill sets in this castle, so that I can move on to castle 2 study for 2021. Because learning Japaneese is harder than the alphabet based languages, I'm going to go more slowly through Japaneese course, than the others and not move ahead until I feel ready to do so. 
* While working thru the "warm up" or "review" skill set levels today, prior to going for the Level 5 on this Katakana 1 skill set, I took screen shots I can use like flashcards to begin to work on my pronounciation skills off line. I parked copies of my "homemade" (screenshot) flashcards in their own folder inside the "images" folder located here: [Images Flashcards Castle 1] (https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/tree/main/polyglot/japon%C3%A9s/images/Flash-Cards-Castle1)
