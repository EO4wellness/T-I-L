Hiragana 4

In the following skill, we introduce a few more elements to basic hiragana.
Hiragana Part II: Dakuten

Putting two little dashes or dakuten at the upper right corner of a hiragana syllable voices the consonant. It changes the pronunciation of the hiragana in the following way:
Sound 	Sound with Dakuten 	Example
k 	g 	か (ka) → が (ga)
s 	z 	さ (sa) → ざ (za), し (shi) → じ (ji)*
t 	d 	た (ta) → だ (da), つ (tsu) → づ (zu)*
h 	b 	は (ha) → ば (ba)

Putting a little circle or handakuten at the upper right corner changes the pronunciation of the は-ひ-ふ-へ-ほ hiragana in the following way:
Sound 	Sound with Handakuten 	Example
h 	p 	は (ha) → ぱ (pa)
Hiragana Part III: Small っ

Putting a っ (small tsu) between two hiragana syllables doubles the letter right after っ and introduces a short pause between two sounds. See some examples below:
Without っ 	With っ
きて (kite) 	きって (kitte)
もと (moto) 	もっと (motto)
あさり (asari) 	あっさり (assari)
Hiragana Part IV: Big and Small Characters

Lastly, this skill introduces the big and small versions of three sounds in hiragana. A small や、ゆ、or よ changes the pronunciation of a word in the following way:
Big や-ゆ-よ 	Small や-ゆ-よ
きや [ki-ya] 	きゃ [kya]
きゆ [ki-yu] 	きゅ [kyu]
きよ [ki-yo] 	きょ [kyo]

The small character changes the two-syllable construction into a one-syllable construction. Sometimes, the difference can lead to a real change in meaning, as shown below:
Big よ 	Small よ
びよういん [bi-yō-in] "beauty salon" 	びょういん [byō-in] "hospital"
