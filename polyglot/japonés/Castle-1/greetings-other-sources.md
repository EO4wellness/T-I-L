      Konnichiwa / こんにちは
      今日は
      Hello
      
      Watashi wa Mariko desu. / わたしはまりこです。
      私は真理子です。
      I am Mariko.
      
      Here's a tip!
      As you may have guessed, "watashi" means "I". So the structure for "I am ..." is "Watashi wa ... desu". 
      Don't worry about "wa" and "desu" for now. We will find out what they mean soon.
