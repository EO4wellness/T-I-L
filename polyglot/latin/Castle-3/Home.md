## This
* The Latin word for "this", hic, has its own irregular declension. 
* For now, just remember the nominative singular forms:

## Infinitive + Solere
* In sentences with the verb soleo (solere, 2nd conj.),
* you will usually see an infinitive (verbs ending in -re, "to ..." in English). 
* Soleo means "I am used to" or "I am accustomed to".
* Example: In lecto dormire soleo., 
* which literally means "I am accustomed to sleeping in a bed." or, more fluently,
* "I usually sleep in a bed."
