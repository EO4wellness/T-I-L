## Passive and Deponent Verbs (3rd conj.)
* Deponent verbs are verbs that are passive in form, but active in meaning. 
* Passive verb endings differ from their active counterparts. 
* In this skill you will encounter the deponent verb loqui. 
* Loqui follows the third conjugation.

* Passive verbs of the third conjugation follow the same pattern. 
* (Note: most forms of "legi" aren't the most useful, 
* but you can apply this pattern to other 3rd conj. verbs.)

## Adverbs of manner
* In English, you can recognize many adverbs by the ending -ly. 
* What is the adverb in the following sentence?
* "We speak quietly in the library."
* This adverb is derived from the adjective quiet. 
* Adjectives give us more information about a noun or a pronoun, 
* while adverbs modify verbs, adjectives or other adverbs. 
* "Quietly" is the answer to the question "How do we speak?", and modifies the verb speak.
* Adverbs derived from adjectives following the -us, -a, -um pattern get the ending -e.

* Exception: bonus (good) becomes bene (well)! 
* You learned this word in the Greetings skill. 
* (Livia se bene habet. = Livia feels well.)
