## 1st-4th Conjugation Review 
 Time to Review! 

![Travel1](#)



## 3rd Conjugation (-ere, -io) 
* Facere/facio (to make, to do) is a verb that follows the third conjugation BUT has a verb stem ending in -i. 
* The two main differences are facio (and not "faco"), and faciunt (and not "facunt").

## Ablative: introduction
* Let's have a quick look at a new case: the ablative! 
* The ablative has several uses, but for now, we will only use it after prepositions (see below).
* We will only use singular 1st declension and 3rd declension words for now.
* When using macrons, you can recognise the abl. fem. sg. ending by the -ƒÅ at the end. (In contrast with the -a for the nominative.)

## Prepositions 
* The words following prepositions (in English words like in, on, for, through) 
require certain grammatical cases in Latin.
* Pay attention to the difference between "in + accusative" and "in + ablative".
* in urbe (in the city) - in urbem (into the city)
