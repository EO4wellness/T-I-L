## "I would like"
* In English, we use the phrase "would like" when requesting something politely (in a shop, restaurant etc.). 
* In Latin, however, we need a special verb form to express this. 
* You would use velim in such situation.
* Note: (Velim is the subjunctive of velle, volo, to want. For now, you don't need to remember this information.)
* Example: 

            __Subject__ 	    __Verb__
            ego 	        velim
            tu 	            velis
            is, ea 	        velit
            nos 	        velimus
            vos 	        velitis
            ii, eae 	    velint
            


## Da mihi vinum!
* We have encountered mihi, tibi and ei earlier in the course. (Nomen mihi est...) 
* These words respectively mean to me, to you (sg), and to him/her.
* This is the indirect object, which is in the dative case. 
* You can find the indirect object by asking the question "To/For whom?".
*  Example:

          I give the book to him. To whom ? -> to him
          I am sending you an email. To whom? -> (to) you
          Give me the wine! To whom? -> (to) me


## Imperative (singular)
Da mihi panem! - Give me the bread!

The verb in this sentence, da, is an imperative. This verb mood is used for commands (when you want to tell someone they must do something). Command sentences do not have a subject.
