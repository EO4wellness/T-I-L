## Time 
* For us, an hour is always sixty minutes. 
* For Romans, an hour was defined as one twelfth of a day (the time between sunrise and sunset). 
* This means that an hour in winter was much shorter than an hour in summer.
* While our starting point is at midnight (00:01 AM) or noon (00:01 PM), 
* Romans started counting their hours at sunrise to tell the time. 
* The "prima hora" was the first hour after sunrise.

## Nouns of the 5th declension
* Nouns of the fifth declension are generally feminine 
* (dies and meridies are exceptions to this rule), and their nominative singular form ends in -es.
