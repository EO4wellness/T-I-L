## NOS ET VOS
* This skill mainly focuses on nos and vos (we and you). 
* Vos is the plural you; you use "vos" to talk about more than one person.
* The "nos" and "vos" forms for third conjugation verbs 
* like facere, facio (verb stem ending in -i) 
* look the same as other third conjugation verbs. (faci-mus, faci-tis)
