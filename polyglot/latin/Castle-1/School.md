Accusative

On to the next case! The accusative is the grammatical case used for direct objects.

You can find the direct object of a sentence by asking the question "Who/What + does X + verb?", in which X is the subject.

Example:

    The man has a rose. What does the man have? -> a rose
    The author writes books. What does the author write? -> books
    I love you. Who do I love? -> you

Declension 	Nom. sg. 	Acc. sg.
1st 	magistra 	magistram
2nd masc. 	discipulus 	discipulum
2nd neut. 	Novum Eboracum 	Novum Eboracum (=)
3rd 	mater 	matrem

The plural forms are:
Declension 	Nom. pl. 	Acc. pl.
1st 	magistrae 	magistras
2nd masc. 	discipuli 	discipulos
2nd neut. 	dona* 	dona (=)
3rd 	matres 	matres (=)

(*donum = gift, present)
-R (second declension)

Not all masculine nouns that follow the second declension end in -us in the nominative, some end in -r or -er.

magister 	magistr-um 	magistr-i 	magistr-os
liber 	libr-um 	libr-i 	libr-os

vir 	virum 	viri 	viros
Third conjugation (-ere, -o)

Legere/lego (to read) and discere/disco (to learn) are verbs that follow the third conjugation. You can recognize these verbs by the lack of a vowel at the end of the verb stem. (-i- is used to connect the stem to the endings, -u- for -nt)
