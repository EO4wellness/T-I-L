# Japaneese | Japones | 
Japanese uses three different writing systems: 1. hiragana 2. katakana 3. kanji.

## Hiragana
This is the mot basic.  It's like an alphabet that uses syllables instead of individual sounds.

## Katakana
Is generally used when writing foreign words and some noises. Although it's different from hiragana, it represents the exact same syllables.

## Kanji
* These are Chinese characters used in the Japanese language to write individual nouns, verbs, and adjectives.<br>
* Kanji are not phonetic, meaning you need to memorize each pronunciation individually.<br>
* Kanji is introduced gradually and methodically.<br>
