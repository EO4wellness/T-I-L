[Zapier's "HOw to Connect to Public WI-FI When you Can't]


### Zapier - How to Connect | Public WI-FI
* This is one of those stealthy resources which on first glance seems ridiculous.  That is UNTIL it happens that you are out and about running errands and need WI-FI access but cannot because you can't get the page to accept the terms and begin using it. 
* Ways to get a public WI-FI Login Screen to open. 

		1. Turn off Alternative DNS servers.
		2. Try to open the router's default page.
		3. Open a non-HTTPS site in incognito.
		4. Restart your device.
		5. Create a new network location. 

* This file was originally offered as a free-to-everyone download from the Zapier website and was originally named "c43f5053f73f750e90ede3de4c65073e.pdf" I edited the file name to suit my ability to remember what's inside the document when I see it in my files list.
