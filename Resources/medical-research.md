# Lesson Guide

Below we've listed the lesson titles and a short description of what's contained in each. No need to read these right now! They have been broken up into "module previews" and spread throughout the course. The list below is meant to be used once you've completed the course.

It's a reference. When you see a study out in the real world and your bad science spidey-sense goes off, you can return here. By skimming through the descriptions or using the control+F command to look up keywords, you'll be able to quickly locate applicable lesson(s) to prove or debunk a claim! 
Lesson Guide:

## The Basics  

1. How Research Works — We’ll explore the process of how an idea goes from hypothesis all the way to a published manuscript. We’ll describe the two main pathways papers can take to reach publication. Along the way you’ll hear what role peer review plays in the process and we'll also delve into some to the perverse incentives at play in the world of medical research.

2. The Medical Manuscript — The central point of this entire course, we'll dissect a typical research paper.  Learn the rules for writing them and simultaneously, the rules for reading them. 

3. The Replication Crisis — Learn about THE big problem plaguing nearly all new medical research. We'll discuss the difference between a positive and a true study. And you'll hear why one paper is almost never enough. 

4. The Question is - what is the Question? — I'll tell you why studies can't always ask the question they really want to be asking in their studies. Learn about the various methods they use to get around this issue. This lesson also introduces causal pathways and the exposure/outcome paradigm, concepts which will stay with us throughout the course. 

## Medical Statistics Made Ridiculously Simple 

5. Types of Data —  Not all data is the same. Knowing what type of data you're dealing with matters for a whole host of reasons.  We'll teach you some of the statistical jargon scientists have come up with to describe different types of data. By the end of this lesson you’ll be able to “talk the talk" and more deeply understand the processes being described by researchers.  

6. Averages by Other Names —  We'll talk "mean" and "median", what they are and when each is appropriate to use. You’ll also be introduced to the concept of a central tendency, learn what a standard deviation refers to and hopefully, we can improve your blackjack game a little along the way.  

7. Sampling the Secret Sauce of Statistics — It’s common to hear a news article state “some such percentage of Americans are obese,” but if you're an American, odds are no one has come to your home and weighed you recently. So how can scientists know this?  Sampling! Hear how scientists are able to extrapolate accurate estimations based on small cohorts and learn to differentiate between good and bad samples.   

8. Statistics as an Onion —  Denominators are really important.  You'll learn how the numbers statistics are based on can be layered in all types of ways from count, to ratio, to ratio of ratios, and beyond! 

9. Relative vs. Absolute Risk — We’re going to let you in on the biggest secret in medicine. This lesson introduces you to the concept of number needed to treat (more on this later). Learn how NNTs influence the everyday practices of medical professions. 

10. The Power and the Problem with the P-Value — Does it sound esoteric? Sure. But P-value is incredibly important! We'll begin to talk about what "significance" means in medical studies and describe what you should really do to interpret whether a study's results are "significant" or not.  

11. Choosing a Statistical Test — We just learned about the importance of a P-value, but how do scientists determine it in the first place?  We'll teach you how scientists decide which tests to use given different types of exposure and outcome data. No math, just a handy chart!

12. Interpretation of "Negative" Studies — What happens if a study's P-value deems its results "Not Statistically Significant." Well, it might still be very useful.  Hear what science can learn from with negative studies (STILL VERY USEFUL) and how you can tell them apart from "underpowered studies" (USELESS).  

13. The Randomized Control Trial — The “gold standard” for medical tests, but why? Learn what makes them so special, how to interpret their data, and how even they can go wrong. 

14. The Cohort Study — The most common study found in medical literacy. These “ultimate marathon” studies are very useful in certain situations but also face some major limitations. We’ll give you the rules of thumb for when it’s okay and not okay to use them, and go through some cohort data. 

15. The Case-Control Study — Rare outcomes are the enemy of the Cohort Study, enter the Case-Control Study. You can think of it as a reverse engineered cohort, find the vampires first!  But these studies come with their own unique set of challenges. 

16. Study of Diagnostic Tests — Find out why an “accurate” test does not equal a good test. Specificity and sensitivity are the two main attributes used to measure a really solid diagnostic. Learn what those words describe in the world of medical research and why diagnostic tests are so important.  

17. Meta-Analysis — Why conduct a study yourself when you can just study other studies? Meta-analysis looks to combine the research efforts of disparate scientific teams. When done right, they can lead to some incredible insights, but they are tricky. A meta study is only good as the studies it looks at, how do you know which to include? Which studies will result in fondue, which in clam chowder?

18. Survival Data — Firefly, come back to us! Survival data or time-to-event data is tricky, it’s literally “non-normal.” This is due to the confusing maxim which states “survivors are more likely to survive.” True not only in science but in most aspects of life, we’ll describe how it should be accounted for and interpreted. 

19. Cost-Effectiveness Study — At the heart of many a controversial debate, the cost-effectiveness study gets a bad rap. Learn how they aren’t really about putting a dollar amount on a human life, they’re about being as efficient as possible with where dollars go in order to do the most good.  

## How Wrong Conclusions are Reached 

20. Causality — When you flip a switch in your house, a light goes on, boom, causality. In science, it’s rarely that simple. Even if scientists “flip a switch” in an experiment and subsequently the “light turns on”  it could be a whole host of things going on behind the scene that are really causing that illumination. In this lecture we’ll talk about what standards have to be met to reasonably infer causality. 

21. Confounding — Variables that falsely link an exposure to an outcome are called confounders and there are an infinite number of them. So how does any science happen? We’ll talk about which tests are most susceptible to confounding and how a well-crafted study can adjust for likely confounders in their methods.  

22. Effect Modification and Mediation —  Say it loud, say it proud, “I will never adjust for factors that lie on the causal pathway.” Smoking causes lung damage, lung damage causes cancer. When the causal pathway is so clear a scientist would never adjust for lung damage and conclude smoking does not cause cancer. They’re inextricable. And yet, sometimes this does happen in experiments where causal pathways are not as well defined. 

23. Generalizability — What’s good for the goose is good for the gander, right? But if you’re mistakenly asking ducks what they think is good, does the adage still apply? When is it appropriate to more broadly apply the lessons learned from a study? When can it actually do damage? 

24. Multiple Comparisons — Some scientists start their studies with a large number of hypotheses in mind. They then run the experiment, test each hypothesis and if one proves true, they claim success! Seems unfair somehow, but maybe it’s fine? Learn how if you play a different game, you need to abide by a different set of rules. 

25. Surrogate Endpoints — There are three “hard” outcomes in medical research, birth rate, death rate, and quality of life. All other studies are designed to look at surrogate end points. Having a high GPA is great, but it’s great because it improves the chances you get into the school you want or get the job you want. GPA is a surrogate endpoint. See what a surrogate endpoints can and can’t tell us and learn how difficult it is to find a “perfect surrogate” in the real world. 

26. Fraud — The dark side of medical research. Where did the antivax movement come from? Simple, a fraudulent medical study, published in 1998, purporting to link the MMR vaccine to autism. Since then it’s gone on to cause irreparable damage on a global scale. There are different of types of fraud, many of which are difficult to prove.  Best way to fight it? Educate yourselves, ask questions, call it out when you see it and remember: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

## Bias

27. Selection Bias — Or the “Geico phenomenon” occurs when a study differentially includes a certain type of person to the extent that its cohort no longer accurately represents the population it would like to know more about. Selection bias is the root cause of a lot of Generalizability issues. 

28. Information Bias — A catch-all term for mismeasurement, especially differential mismeasurement, information bias occurs when data is consistently recorded inaccurately. It happens to the best of us! We’ll talk through some common examples of info bias and explain how they impact outcomes.  

29. Time-based bias — The Stone is back! A subset of information bias, time-based biases like immortal time bias and lead-in bias are some of the most subtle to occur in medical research. Whereas selection bias is linked to generalizability, time-based biases are linked to survival data. 

30. Statistical Brain Teasers — Take a break and put the knowledge your intuition to the test! 

## Fixing the Problems with Medical Studies

31. Adjustment — Does Rosé make you short? Scientists can use math to filter results and better expose the pure relationship between exposure and outcome. Learn some common types of adjustment and when they’re appropriate to use. 

32. Matching — A specialized form of adjustment where you try and match up exposed and non-exposed subjects and compare their outcomes. Matching is a very simple concept but, like speed dating, it can go wrong in a lot of ways. Learn what makes for a good match and what problems matching can and can’t fix. 

33. Propensity Scoring — propensity scoring is a fancy term for what is essentially stereotyping. PS uses a set of characteristics to predict a certain exposure, for us that’s usually medication usage.  Learn the differences between being the sort of person who does a thing and actually doing the thing and see how propensity scoring can improve matching strategies. 

34. Putting It All Together —  Parting is such sweet sorrow.  You’ve got the pieces, let’s look at the whole puzzle.  We’ll give you the BIG take home points and say goodbye!
