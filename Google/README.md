# Google 
* T-I-L about some google resources, I didn't know existed, prior to discovering it today.  
* It makes sense Google would have this type of Library available.  The placer were I learned about this says there are more such libraries available, too. 
* Later on, I will also research how this works in the non-Google libraries and which ones are available, as even in this course they say Google is apparently blocked in some countries. (Insert my What? face here)

## Font Libraries
* Discovered 2021-01-09 via FreeCodeCamp.com CSS course. 
* While working a CODE assingment for the FreeCodeCamp lessons, I came accross their link to [Google Font Library](https://fonts.google.com/) for the first time.
* While on the page, for the first time ever, they have a blue pop-out box which offers: [More Info](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/) or to dismiss the message.

For more information and resources, not just hosted by Google, about fonts and the use of fonts in coding and design elements, head on over to my [T-I-L Wiki Design-Fonts](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/wiki/Design-Fonts) artcicle.

##  More Google discoveries pending future study sessions on other days....

More Google Resources are available in the [#GrowWithGoogle Events](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L/tree/main/Events/Google) folder.
